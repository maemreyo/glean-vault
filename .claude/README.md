# Claude Kit Configuration

This directory contains the configuration for Claude Code's intelligent agent system.

## Directory Structure

```

## How It Works

### 1. Commands → Agents → Skills
- **Commands** are user-facing entry points (e.g., `/how`, `/fix-issues`)
- **Agents** are specialized AI entities that handle specific types of tasks
- **Skills** are specialized capabilities that agents automatically trigger

### 2. Automatic Skill Integration
Each agent has automatic skill triggers based on task context:
- No manual skill configuration required
- Skills are loaded dynamically
- Multiple skills can be triggered for complex tasks

### 3. Key Components

#### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)
Define user-facing workflows and how they orchestrate agents:
- `/how` - Multi-phase codebase exploration
- `/fix-issues` - Intelligent issue resolution
- `/plan` - Task decomposition and planning

#### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)
Specialized AI agents with automatic skill triggers:
- `scout` - Codebase exploration and file discovery
- `debugger` - Bug analysis and root cause tracing
- `tester` - Test generation and validation
- `security-auditor` - Security vulnerability assessment
- `frontend-developer` - UI/UX implementation and fixes
- `backend-architect` - Backend architecture and API design

#### Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
Specialized capabilities and methodologies:
- `codebase-exploration` - Multi-phase systematic exploration
- `systematic-debugging` - Methodical error analysis
- `comprehensive-testing` - Thorough test coverage strategies
- `pattern-analysis` - Pattern recognition and extraction

## Usage Examples

### Code Exploration
```bash
/how "authentication flow"
```
- Triggers: Scout Agent
- Auto-triggers: codebase-exploration skill
- Coordinates: Multiple agents for comprehensive analysis

### Bug Fixing
```bash
/fix-issues --type=bugs,security
```
- Dynamic agent selection based on issue type
- Bugs → Debugger Agent (auto-triggers debugging skills)
- Security → Security Auditor (auto-triggers security patterns)

### Test Generation
```bash
/test-from "authentication"
```
- Uses Tester Agent
- Auto-triggers: comprehensive-testing skill
- Generates tests based on exploration documentation

## Configuration Files

### CLAUDE.md
Main project context file that:
- Describes the agent system at a high level
- Lists available commands
- Defines project conventions
- Points to detailed configurations

### Agent Definitions
Each agent file (`.claude/agents/[name].md`) defines:
- Agent responsibilities and capabilities
- Automatic skill triggers
- Tools and workflows
- Collaboration patterns

### Skill Definitions
Each skill file (`.claude/skills/[category]/[skill]/SKILL.md`) defines:
- Detailed methodology
- Best practices
- Execution patterns
- Integration guidelines

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Available Commands**: Check the Commands section in CLAUDE.md
2. **Understand Agent Capabilities**: Browse `.claude/agents/` to see available agents
3. **Learn About Skills**: Review `.claude/skills/` for specialized capabilities
4. **Run a Command**: Start with `/how [feature]` to see the system in action

## Best Practices

1. **Trust Automatic Triggers**: Agents automatically detect when to use skills
2. **Follow Command Patterns**: Each command handles agent orchestration
3. **Check Documentation**: Each agent and skill has detailed documentation
4. **Contribute New Patterns**: Add new agents/skills following the established structure

## Integration with Development Workflow

The agent system integrates seamlessly with development:
- **Planning Phase**: Use `/plan` or `/auto-plan` for task decomposition
- **Exploration Phase**: Use `/how` for understanding codebases
- **Implementation Phase**: Commands automatically select appropriate agents
- **Quality Assurance**: Use `/fix-issues` to address problems
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated by agents during execution
