- Complete exploration of topic
- Uncovers all aspects

### Charette Procedure
- Divide into small groups
- Brainstorm for set time
- Rotate groups
- Build on previous groups' ideas

### Reverse Brainstorming Deep Dive
### Problem Generation
- "How could we make this worse?"
- "What would guarantee failure?"
- "How can we create more problems?"
- "What if everything goes wrong?"

### Problem Transformation
- Reverse each problem to solution
- Identify underlying assumptions
- Find opportunities in chaos
- Develop contingency plans

## Ideation Games

### Worst Possible Idea
- Intentionally generate terrible ideas
- Useful for breaking creative blocks
- Reveals hidden assumptions
- Can spark genuine innovations

### Attribute Listing
- List all attributes of problem
- Modify each attribute
- Combine modified attributes
- Generate new solutions

### Morphological Boxes
- Define parameters of solution
- List all possible values
- Create matrix of combinations
- Select promising combinations
