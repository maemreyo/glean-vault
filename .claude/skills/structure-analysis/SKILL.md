# Structure Analysis - Grammar Intelligence

Systematic grammar structure and pattern analysis that identifies linguistic patterns, formulates rules, generates contextual examples, and populates structure templates comprehensively.

## Prerequisites

This skill uses AI linguistic knowledge for pattern analysis and example generation. **No web search required**.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Pattern recognition and formulation
- Grammar rule extraction
- Contextual example generation
- Register and usage mapping
- Related structure identification

## How to Use This Skill

When user requests structure analysis (`/structure` command), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze Input

Extract key information from user request:
- **Pattern/Structure**: Name or description of grammar pattern
- **Mode**: Single file or batch processing
- **Context**: Register, domain, or specific usage context if provided

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition & Analysis

**Pattern Identification:**
```
Structure Name → Pattern Formula → Components → Rules → Variations
```

**What to identify:**
- **Pattern formula**: [Subject] + [Verb] + [Object]
- **Fixed components**: Unchangeable parts
- **Variable slots**: Parts that can be modified
- **Formation rules**: How to construct the pattern
- **Variations**: Different forms of the same pattern

### Step 3: Contextual Analysis

**Usage Contexts:**
- **Register**: Formal, informal, neutral, academic, business
- **Domain**: General, technical, creative writing
- **Frequency**: Common, moderate, rare
- **CEFR Level**: A1-C2 complexity

**Functional Analysis:**
- **Purpose**: What the structure communicates
- **Effect**: Intended impact on listener/reader
- **Semantic role**: Grammatical function

### Step 4: Template Population

Fill the structure template (see `99_Templates/tpl_Structure.md`):
- 📊 Meta Information
- 🔍 Structural Analysis
- 💡 Meaning & Usage
- 🔗 Relations & Connections
- 📝 Usage Examples
- ⚠️ Common Mistakes

## Analysis Domains

### Domain 1: Pattern Recognition

**What to identify:**
- Pattern type (tense, mood, voice, clause type, etc.)
- Structural formula with components
- Formation rules and constraints
- Variations and transformations

**Pattern Formula Format:**
```
[Component 1] + [Component 2] + [Component 3] + ...

Example: Passive Voice
[Subject] + [be] + [Past Participle] + (by + [Agent])
```

### Domain 2: Meaning & Function

**What to analyze:**
- Literal vs. figurative meaning
- Functional purpose in communication
- Semantic role and relations
- Nuances compared to similar structures

**Questions to answer:**
- When is this structure used?
- What does it express or emphasize?
- How does it differ from alternatives?

### Domain 3: Usage Contexts

**What to map:**
- Register preferences (formal/informal)
- Domain-specific usage
- Frequency in different contexts
- Regional or stylistic variations

**Generate examples for:**
- Formal writing
- Informal conversation
- Academic discourse
- Business communication
- Creative writing

### Domain 4: Error Patterns

**What to identify:**
- Common mistakes by learners
- Why these mistakes occur
- Correct vs. incorrect usage
- How to avoid errors

**Pattern:**
```
❌ Wrong: [incorrect example]
✅ Right: [correct example]
💡 Explanation: [why and how to fix]
```

### Domain 5: Context & Advanced Analysis

**What to analyze:**
- **Situation**: Specific scenario where the structure is most effective.
- **Rhetorical Effects**: Emphasis, clarity, conciseness, persuasion.
- **Frequency**: Distribution across genres (Academic, Business, Fiction, etc.).
- **Cultural Notes**: Dialectal variations (US vs UK) or cultural implications.

### Domain 6: Quick Reference & Tags

**What to generate:**
- **Cheat Sheet**: Concise formula and top 3 rules.
- **Dos and Don'ts**: Quick usage guide.
- **Signal Words**: Words that trigger or accompany the structure.
- **Tags**: Functional classification (e.g., #politeness, #probability).

### Domain 7: Relations & Connections

**What to map:**
- Similar structures (with key differences)
- Contrasting structures (how they differ)
- Related concepts and patterns
- Progressive learning path

**Format:**
```
Similar to [[structure-name]]:
- Difference: [key distinction]
- When to use each: [guidance]
```

## Example Generation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Context Variety

Generate examples across different contexts:

```markdown
**Formal Context:**
Sentence: [Professional/academic example]
Translation: [Vietnamese]
Analysis: [Why this structure fits]

**Informal Context:**
Sentence: [Casual/conversational example]
Translation: [Vietnamese]
Analysis: [Register appropriateness]

**Academic Context:**
Sentence: [Scholarly/research example]
Translation: [Vietnamese]
Analysis: [Technical usage]

**Business Context:**
Sentence: [Corporate/professional example]
Translation: [Vietnamese]
Analysis: [Professional application]
```

### Strategy 2: Complexity Progression

Start simple, build complexity:

1. **Basic**: Simple subject + verb combinations
2. **Intermediate**: Add complexity (modifiers, clauses)
3. **Advanced**: Multiple clauses, nuanced usage

### Strategy 3: Error-Driven Learning

Show mistakes alongside corrections:

```markdown
Common Mistake #1:
❌ [Typical error]
✅ [Correction]
💡 [Explanation of the rule]
```

## Common Rules for Structure Analysis

### Pattern Recognition Rules

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Formula clarity** | Use consistent notation: [Component] + [Component] | Use vague descriptions |
| **Component labeling** | Label clearly: [Subject], [Verb], etc. | Use ambiguous terms |
| **Variation documentation** | Show all common variations | Only show one form |
| **Rule precision** | State exactly when/how to use | Give vague guidelines |

### Example Generation Rules

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Natural language** | Use authentic, current examples | Create artificial sentences |
| **Context diversity** | Cover formal, informal, academic, business | Only use one register |
| **Translation accuracy** | Provide contextual Vietnamese translation | Use literal word-for-word |
| **Analysis depth** | Explain why the structure fits the context | Just list examples |

### Template Population Rules

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Use Existing Structure** | Fill the specific rows/cells in existing tables | Create new headers or tables |
| **Obsidian Links** | Format as `[[structure]]`. Separate with spaces: `[[a]] [[b]]` | Use hyphens/commas between links |
| **Complete sections** | Fill EVERY section including Advanced Analysis, Context, and Quick Reference | Leave no section empty (except user-specific fields) |
| **Progressive detail** | Start simple, build complexity | Jump to advanced too quickly |
| **Error focus** | Highlight common mistakes with fixes | Only show correct usage |

## Workflow Example

**User request:** `/structure struct/passive-voice.md`

**Analysis Process:**

```markdown
# 1. Pattern Recognition
Pattern: Passive Voice
Formula: [Subject] + [be] + [Past Participle] + (by + [Agent])
Type: Voice transformation

# 2. Component Analysis
- Subject: Receiver of action
- Be: Auxiliary (conjugated for tense)
- Past Participle: Main verb form
- Agent: (Optional) Actor in by-phrase

# 3. Formation Rules
- Subject = Object from active voice
- Verb = be + past participle
- Agent = Subject from active voice (optional)

# 4. Usage Contexts
- Formal: Research papers, reports
- Academic: Scientific writing
- Business: Formal communications
- Avoid: Casual conversation (prefer active)

# 5. Example Generation
Formal: "The report was submitted by the team yesterday."
Informal: "They submitted the report yesterday." (Active preferred)
Academic: "The hypothesis was tested using controlled experiments."
Business: "Your application has been approved by management."

# 6. Common Mistakes
❌ "The cake was baked by me yesterday." (Awkward in casual speech)
✅ "I baked the cake yesterday." (Active more natural)

❌ "Was finished the project." (Missing agent/by-phrase)
✅ "The project was finished." (Correct passive)
```

**Then:** Populate `tpl_Structure.md` with all analysis.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be systematic** - Follow the pattern: Recognition → Analysis → Examples → Mistakes
2. **Context matters** - Always explain when/why to use the structure
3. **Show variations** - Document all common forms
4. **Teach with errors** - Common mistakes are learning opportunities
5. **Link related patterns** - Help users see connections
6. **Natural examples** - Use authentic, current language
7. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, layer complexity

## Batch Processing Notes

When processing multiple files:
1. Extract pattern from each filename
2. Process sequentially with consistent methodology
3. Track progress and errors
4. Update `process_status` from `pending` to `done`

**Error handling:** Skip invalid patterns but complete valid ones.
