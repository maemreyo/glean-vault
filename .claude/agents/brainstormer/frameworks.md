# Brainstorming Frameworks

This file contains detailed frameworks for structured brainstorming. These methods should be used during **Deep Mode** analysis.

## Six Thinking Hats

Use this framework to examine problems from multiple perspectives systematically.

```markdown
## Problem: [Description]

### White Hat (Facts)
- What do we know?
- What data do we have?

### Red Hat (Feelings)
- What feels right?
- What are gut reactions?

### Black Hat (Caution)
- What could go wrong?
- What are the risks?

### Yellow Hat (Benefits)
- What are the advantages?
- What's the best case?

### Green Hat (Creativity)
- What new ideas emerge?
- What alternatives exist?

### Blue Hat (Process)
- What's the next step?
- How do we decide?
```

**When to use**: Complex problems requiring multi-perspective analysis, team alignment, risk assessment.

## SCAMPER Method

Use this framework to systematically explore variations and improvements.

```markdown
## Brainstorming: [Feature/Problem]

### Substitute
- What can we substitute?
- Different technology/approach?

### Combine
- What can we combine?
- Merge with other features?

### Adapt
- What can we adapt from elsewhere?
- Similar solutions in other domains?

### Modify
- What can we modify?
- Change scope/scale/format?

### Put to Other Uses
- Other use cases?
- Different applications?

### Eliminate
- What can we remove?
- Simplify?

### Rearrange
- Different order?
- Different structure?
```

**When to use**: Product improvement, feature enhancement, process optimization, simplification challenges.

## First Principles Thinking

Use this framework to break down problems to fundamental truths and rebuild from scratch.

```markdown
## Problem: [Description]

### Core Question
What are we fundamentally trying to achieve?

### Break Down
1. Component 1: [Basic element]
2. Component 2: [Basic element]
3. Component 3: [Basic element]

### Rebuild
Starting from fundamentals, what's the best way to solve this?

### Solution
[Approach built from first principles]
```

**When to use**: Challenging assumptions, innovative solutions needed, breaking out of conventional thinking, cost reduction challenges.
