> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Thời gian==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Volunteering== at ==Festivals==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Specific ==date== when new volunteers begin their duties and training program
>
> - **Denotation:** The ==starting point== in time for volunteer activities, referring to a calendar date in September
>
> - **Distractor:** Similar dates like "2 September" (early), "23 September" (late) - need to listen carefully for modifiers like "not until", "actually", or specific phrases
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS Listening, time/date questions often involve ==comparison phrases== such as "not the first week", "the second week", "after the training", or specific calendar references. Listen for phrases like "week beginning", "starting from", or "commencing" to identify the correct temporal reference

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Looking at a ==calendar page== with September highlighted, seeing volunteer schedule posted on a notice board
>
> - **Auditory:** Coordinator saying "So, we're looking at the week beginning..." or "Your actual duties start from..."
>
> - **Action:** Circling dates on a schedule, marking volunteer start date in diary
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: schedule + volunteers, arrange + training, begin + working, start + duties
>
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: week + of + September, beginning + of + September
>
> - `Adj + Noun`: new + volunteers, actual + work, training + session

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I'm afraid we can't start until the week beginning the 9th"
>
> - "The training session's actually in the week of September 9th"
>
> - "We're looking at starting work from the week beginning September 9th"
>
> - "You'll be beginning your duties in the second week of September"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** =="2 Sep" mentioned first==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Speaker may mention "2 September" as when they wanted to start or when something else happens, using "but" or "however" to negate it
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The date 2 September might be when training was planned or when other activities occur, but NOT when volunteers actually start working
>
> **Trap 2:** =="23 Sep" as late option==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Speaker might mention late September as a contingency or for future events, making it sound like a possibility
>
> - *Actual meaning:* 23 September could refer to a different event, backup plan, or future festival, not the current volunteer start date

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "We originally planned for the week beginning September 2nd, but the training's been moved, so you won't be starting until the week beginning September 9th instead."
>
> → **Match:** ==B. 9 Sep==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "Your induction's on the 2nd, but you won't be doing any actual work then. The week you'll be starting your duties is the week beginning September 9th."
>
> → **Match:** ==B. 9 Sep==

### Card 12: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "We've got the orientation scheduled for September 2nd, and some people might be coming in then. But for actual volunteering work, we're looking at September 23rd. Oh wait, sorry, I'm getting mixed up - it's not the 23rd either, that's for the winter festival. The week you'll be working is the one beginning September 9th."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** =="2 Sep"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* "orientation scheduled for September 2nd"
>
> - *Wrong because:* This is for orientation, not actual volunteering work; speaker clarifies "but for actual volunteering..."
>
> **2. Distractor:** =="23 Sep"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* "we're looking at September 23rd"
>
> - *Wrong because:* Speaker immediately corrects themselves "sorry, I'm getting mixed up" - it's for a different festival
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==9 Sep==
> - *Why correct:* Final clarification "The week you'll be working is the one beginning September 9th"

### Card 13: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** ==9 Sep==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "Right, so regarding when you'll be starting - not September 2nd, that's just paperwork. And definitely not September 23rd, that's when the festival ends. The actual week you'll begin your volunteer duties is the week beginning September 9th. That gives you enough time to get familiar with everything."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Highlight== và giải thích tất cả các ==paraphrases== từ Audio → Option?
?
> [!example] 🎯 Paraphrase Mapping
> - =="week beginning September 9th"== → =="9 Sep"== (exact match)
>
> - =="actual week you'll begin"== → confirms this is the real start date
>
> - =="start your volunteer duties"== → connects to working, not just orientation
>
> **🧠 Overall Logic:** The speaker negates both alternative dates (2 Sep for paperwork, 23 Sep as festival end) and explicitly confirms September 9th as the volunteer work start date
