> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Thời gian==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Volunteering==
>
> **🧠 6D Framework (Logic & Lexical):**
> - **Definition:** ==the specific date when volunteer work or activities begin==
>
> - **Denotation (Nghĩa đen):** ==the calendar date marking the start of volunteer involvement==
>
> - **Distractor:** ==week of September (ambiguous timeframe), beginning of September (not specific), after September (too general)==
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing sâu hơn: ==starting from, beginning on, commencing on, the week starting from, from the second of September==
>
> - **Antonyms (Logic Flip):** Các từ/cấu trúc phủ định hoặc đối lập hoàn toàn: ==finishing work, ending involvement, final day, concluding date, completion of tasks==
>
> - **Synonym Chain (Verbs):**
>   - ==start/begin== → Syn: ==commence, launch, initiate== | Ant: ==cease, stop, terminate==
>   - ==work/assist== → Syn: ==labor, operate, function== | Ant: ==idle, rest, quit==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers (Verb-Focused):**
>
> - **Visual:** ==calendar dates marked== (seeing circles on Sep 2), ==schedule documents== (reading PDFs), ==weekly planners== (checking agendas), ==volunteer roster== (viewing names)
>
> - **Auditory:** ==reading dates aloud== (listening to 2nd Sep), ==confirming start dates== (hearing "confirmed"), ==discussing schedules== (talking about Monday)
>
> - **Action:** ==circling dates== (marking calendar), ==confirming plans== (shaking hands on date), ==checking availability== (looking at own schedule)
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: start + working, begin + on, commence + from
>
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: beginning + of + September
>
> - `Adj + Noun`: new + volunteers, upcoming + dates

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "You'll start working in the week beginning September 2nd."
>
> - "The week starting from the second of September."
>
> - "Volunteers begin work from the second of September."
>
> - "Your first week will be the week of September 2nd."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==9 Sep==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* ==Also in September, might be mentioned as a training day or orientation date==
>
> - *Actual meaning:* ==Could be mentioned as a specific activity date, but NOT the start working week==
>
> **Trap 2:** ==23 Sep==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* ==Another September date that might be mentioned for festival events==
>
> - *Actual meaning:* ==Likely referenced as festival event date, not volunteer work start date==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Regarding when new volunteers will start working, it'll be the week beginning 2nd September. There's an orientation session on the 9th, and the festival itself begins on the 23rd, but your volunteer work starts from the week of September 2nd."
>
> → **Match:** ==2 Sep==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "Your volunteer work begins in the week starting 2 September. The actual festival doesn't start until the 23rd, and there's training on the 9th, but you'll need to be working from the second onwards."

>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown

> - Uses contrast markers to distinguish dates: "while," "but," "earlier"
> - Directly answers question about volunteer work start date with explicit language

### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==2 Sep==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We weren't looking at ==finishing in early September== or ==ending work then==; as it turns out, we're ==starting then==, specifically the ==week beginning September 2nd==..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK 2 Sep==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "weren't looking at X (Antonym); instead, starting then Y (Synonym)" đã phủ định sự kết thúc (Antonym) và khẳng định sự bắt đầu. 
> - Finishing = Antonym of Starting
> - → Week beginning September 2nd = 2 Sep start date.
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận diện đúng mốc thời gian khi người nói bác bỏ các khái niệm "kết thúc/hoàn tất" (Antonyms) để giới thiệu ngày bắt đầu chính thức.
