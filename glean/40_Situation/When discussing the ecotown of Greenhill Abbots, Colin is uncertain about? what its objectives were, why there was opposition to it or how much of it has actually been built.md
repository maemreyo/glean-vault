> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==what its objectives were== | mục tiêu là gì | goals, aims, purposes, targets | ⚠️ High |
> | B | ==why there was opposition to it== | tại sao phản đối với dự án | resistance, protests, objections, criticism | ⚠️ Low |
> | C | ==how much of it has actually been built== | đã xây được bao nhiêu | construction progress, completion level, built amount | ⚠️ Medium |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==A. what its objectives were==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Mục tiêu/Lý do== của dự án (Project purpose/Reasoning)
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Academic Research / Environmental Studies / Urban Planning==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** ==What its objectives were== refers to the intended goals, purposes, or targets that the ecotown project was designed to achieve when it was originally conceived
>
> - **Denotation:** Direct meaning includes: original goals, planned aims, intended purposes, what it was supposed to accomplish, target outcomes
>
> - **Distractor:** Similar phrases include "what happened," "how successful it was," "what features it has" - these focus on OUTCOMES, not ==original intentions==
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS context, speakers may paraphrase "objectives" as: "goals," "aims," "purposes," "targets," "what it was supposed to achieve," "what they planned to accomplish"

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Looking at project proposals, plans showing intended environmental goals, diagrams of what the ecotown was meant to achieve
>
> - **Auditory:** Hearing discussions about "the goals," "the aims," "what they wanted to achieve," "the original purpose," "what it was supposed to do"
>
> - **Action:** Planners reviewing objectives, students questioning unclear goals, comparing intended vs. actual outcomes, discussing project purposes
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + objectives`: understand, clarify, define, identify, be uncertain about, question
>
> - `Adjective + objectives`: original, main, key, stated, intended
>
> - `Objectives + preposition`: of, for, behind

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "He's not sure about the ==goals== of the project."
>
> - "He's uncertain what the ==aims were==."
>
> - "He doesn't clearly understand the ==objectives==."
>
> - "The ==original purposes== aren't clear."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==why there was opposition to it==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Oppositive projects often face resistance, and "opposition" is a commonly discussed issue in environmental debates
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The uncertainty is specifically about GOALS/OBJECTIVES, not about protest/opposition - that's a separate, clearer issue
>
> **Trap 2:** ==how much of it has actually been built==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Construction progress is a logical thing to be uncertain about in development projects
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The uncertainty is about OBJECTIVES (intended purposes), not physical completion - what it was MEANT TO DO

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "When they discussed Greenhill Abbots ecotown, Colin expressed that he was uncertain about what its objectives were. He mentioned that he didn't really understand the original goals of the project."
>
> → **Match:** ==what its objectives were==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "Colin noted that while he knew some things about the ecotown, he was unclear about what its aims were. He explained that the original purposes of Greenhill Abbots weren't clearly defined to him."
>
> → **Match:** ==what its objectives were==

### Card 6: Trap Identification (Spot the Lie)

> **Option:** ==how much of it has actually been built==
>
> ❓ **Reflex Drill:** Nếu Audio nói: *"They don't know the completion percentage"* → **Số phận** option này thế nào?
?
> [!fail] 🛑 Spot the Lie
> **👉 Verdict:** ==LOẠI NGAY== (False)
>
> **⚠️ Why? (Trap Signal):**
> "Don't know the completion percentage" is about CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS, not PROJECT OBJECTIVES. The uncertainty is about GOALS, not how much was built.
>
> **🔄 Reality Check:** Audio specifically focuses on "objectives," "goals," "aims" - not construction completion

### Card 7: Confusion Differentiation

> **Comparison:** Phân biệt =="what its objectives were"== với =="what its outcomes were"==?
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Sự khác biệt cốt lõi== là gì?
?
> [!example] 🆚 Distinction
> - **what its objectives were:** Tập trung vào MỤC ĐÍNH NHẰM LÊN (what they PLANNED to do) - mục tiêu ban đầu
>
> - **what its outcomes were:** Tập trung vào KẾT QUẢ THỰC TẠI (what actually HAPPENED) - kết quả đạt được
>
> **🧱 Key Barrier:** "Objectives" = định hướng trước; "outcomes" = kết quả sau - cần nghe từ khóa về kế hoạch/định hướng (goals, aims, purposes, supposed to)

> **📝 Grammar Check:**
> - **Plural/Singular:** OBJECTIVES (plural) - "what the objectives" implies multiple goals/targets of a project
>
> - **Spelling Trap:** Watch "objectives" spelling (o-b-j-e-c-t-i-v-e-s, not "obectives") and "ecotown" spelling
>
> **🔗 Connects to:** ==what its objectives were==

#flashcards/ielts-listening/science-tech/sustainability/biweekly/01-full-trap
### Card 15: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "Colin discussed Greenhill Abbots ecotown with another student. He acknowledged that he knew there had been ==opposition to it== from some residents, and he was aware of ==how much had been built==. However, what he expressed uncertainty about was the ==objectives== of the project. He explained that he didn't really understand the ==goals== or ==aims== that the ecotown was supposed to achieve. The other student was more familiar with the project purposes, but Colin remained unclear about the original targets."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** ==why there was opposition to it==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Valid concern mentioned about community reaction
>
> - *Wrong because:* Colin "knew" and "was aware" of this - he UNDERSTOOD this issue, so NOT uncertain about it
>
> **2. Distractor:** ==how much of it has actually been built==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Practical project detail that one could be unsure about
>
> - *Wrong because:* Colin "was aware of" construction progress - he KNEW this, so NOT uncertain about completion level
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==what its objectives were==
> - *Why correct:* "expressed uncertainty about" + "didn't really understand" + "goals" + "aims" + "supposed to achieve" = clear confusion about intended purposes
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When identifying what someone is "uncertain about," distinguish between things they KNOW about (acknowledged, aware) versus what they DON'T KNOW (uncertain, unclear, don't understand)

### Card 16: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** ==what its objectives were==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "When discussing Greenhill Abbots ecotown, Colin shared his perspective. He noted that he was aware there had been ==opposition to the project== and that he knew about ==how much had been built==. However, what he was uncertain about was the ==objectives== of the development. He explained that he didn't clearly understand the ==goals==, ==aims==, or ==purposes== that the ecotown was supposed to achieve. Colin mentioned that while the other student knew the original targets, he remained unclear about what the project intended to accomplish."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Highlight== và giải thích tất cả các ==paraphrases== từ Audio → Option?
?
> [!example] 🎯 Paraphrase Mapping
> - ==goals== → objectives (goals = objectives, both mean intended aims)
>
> - ==aims== → objectives (aims = objectives, both mean intended purposes)
>
> - ==purposes== → objectives (purposes = objectives, both mean what something was meant to do)
>
> - ==supposed to achieve== → reinforces objectives meaning (what they wanted to accomplish)
>
> **🧠 Overall Logic:** Multiple paraphrases for intended purposes confirm answer; opposition and construction are mentioned but as things Colin "was aware of" (not uncertain about)

### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==When discussing the ecotown of Greenhill Abbots, Colin is uncertain about...?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. what its objectives were** (✅) → What Colin is uncertain about
>
> 2. **B. why there was opposition to it** (❌) → Something Colin was aware of, not uncertain about
>
> 3. **C. how much of it has actually been built** (❌) → Something Colin knew, not uncertain about
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Audio begins with Colin acknowledging what he DOES know (opposition existed, construction progress)
> - Then uses uncertainty signals like "what he was uncertain about," "didn't really understand," "remained unclear" to identify what he DOESN'T KNOW
> - Confirms the answer with multiple objective-related paraphrases: "goals," "aims," "purposes," "supposed to achieve," "intended to accomplish"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Opposition and construction are mentioned as "aware of" or "knew" - these are things Colin understood, so cannot be what he's "uncertain about"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** "Uncertain about" + "didn't really understand" + objective vocabulary (objectives, goals, aims, purposes) = correct answer
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** In uncertainty questions ("is uncertain about"), distinguish between AWARE/KNOWN items (acknowledged, knew, aware) versus the specific UNKNOWN item - the subject of the uncertainty itself
