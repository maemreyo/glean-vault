> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==helping people find their seats== | Giúp mọi người tìm chỗ ngồi của họ | guide people to seats, show seating, assist with seating | ⚠️ Medium |

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Hành động / Trách nhiệm== (Action/Responsibility)
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Volunteering== / Venue Management
>
> **🧠 6D Framework (Logic & Lexical):**
> - **Definition:** Tình nguyện viên hỗ trợ người tham quan ==định vị chỗ ngồi== của họ tại khu vực biểu diễn hoặc sân khấu
>
> - **Denotation (Nghĩa đen):** "Helping people find their seats" = "guide people to seating" = "show where to sit" = "assist with seating arrangements"
>
> - **Distractor:** "Giving advice" nghe giống vì cũng là hỗ trợ khách, nhưng đó là trả lời câu hỏi chung chứ không phải ==hướng dẫn đến chỗ ngồi cụ thể==
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing sâu = ==direct people to their allocated seats, help guests locate their seating areas, guide audience members to their places, assist with seating arrangements==
>
> - **Antonyms (Logic Flip):** Các từ/cấu trúc phủ định hoặc đối lập hoàn toàn: ==sitting down elsewhere, wandering around venue, leaving the seating area, blocking aisles, no assigned seating, standing only events==
>
> - **Synonym Chain (Verbs):**
>   - ==locate/find== → Syn: ==detect, spot, identify== | Ant: ==lose, misplace, miss==
>   - ==guide/direct== → Syn: ==conduct, escort, lead== | Ant: ==follow, trail, wander==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers (Verb-Focused):**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung tình nguyện viên ==cầm vé== hoặc ==bản đồ== (holding tickets/maps) khu vực ngồi, đang ==chỉ tay hướng dẫn== (pointing directions) khách đến số ghế hoặc khu vực của họ
>
> - **Auditory:** Tiếng khách ==hỏi== (listening to questions) "Where is seat A15?", câu ==trả lời== "Go down this aisle, second row on your right" (giving directions), tiếng ==phát loa== (hearing announcement) về ghế ngồi
>
> - **Action:** Hành động cụ thể: ==kiểm tra vé== (checking tickets), ==dẫn khách đến chỗ== (escorting guests), ==xếp chỗ ngồi== (arranging seating), ==chỉ đường== (directing people)

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung tình nguyện viên cầm vé hoặc bản đồ khu vực ngồi, đang ==chỉ tay hướng dẫn== khách đến số ghế hoặc khu vực của họ
>
> - **Auditory:** Tiếng khách hỏi "Where is seat A15?", câu trả lời "Go down this aisle, second row on your right", tiếng cảm ơn "Thank you!"
>
> - **Action:** Người tổ chức nói "Your job is to ==direct people== to their assigned seating areas"
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: find + seats, locate + seating, guide + people, show + places, direct + guests
>
> - `Noun + Preposition + Noun`: seating + for + events, seats + in + rows, assigned + areas

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "Your role will be ==helping people find their seats== in the main auditorium"
>
> - "Volunteers are needed to ==guide guests== to their assigned seating"
>
> - "You'll be ==assisting people== with finding their places"
>
> - "The job involves ==showing visitors== where to sit"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==giving advice to visitors== (đánh lạc hướng)
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cả hai đều là hỗ trợ khách tham quan, đều là nói chuyện trả lời câu hỏi
>
> - *Actual meaning:* "Giving advice" là cung cấp thông tin chung về lễ hội (lịch trình, hoạt động). "Finding seats" là ==hướng dẫn đến vị trí cụ thể== cho ghế của từng người
>
> **Trap 2:** ==providing entertainment==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cả hai đều diễn ra tại khu vực biểu diễn nơi khách ngồi và xem biểu diễn
>
> - *Actual meaning:* "Providing entertainment" là người biểu diễn. "Helping find seats" là tình nguyện viên ==đứng ngoài sân khấu== hỗ trợ khách tìm chỗ

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "For the main stage performances, we need volunteers to help people find their seats. Many attendees will have reserved seating with specific row and seat numbers. Your task will be to check their tickets and guide them to the correct area - whether it's front row, back section, or one of the side areas."
>
> → **Match:** ==helping people find their seats==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "We're expecting a full house for the evening concerts. Volunteers in this role will be stationed at various entry points to the seating area.

### Card 6: Trap Identification (Spot the Lie)

?
> [!fail] 🛑 Spot the Lie

>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** =="selling tickets at the entrance"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Được nhắc đến trước với "Some volunteers will be..." và liên quan đến khu vực biểu diễn
>
> - *Wrong because:* Audio nói rõ "But the main seating assistance role involves helping people find their seats" - bán vé là vai trò khác
>
> **2. Distractor:** =="giving advice about the schedule"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Cũng được nhắc như một vai trò tình nguyện viên khác
>
> - *Wrong because:* "But the main seating assistance role" xác định rõ helping find seats là trách nhiệm chính
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==helping people find their seats==
> - *Why correct:* Audio dùng "main seating assistance role involves" để nhấn mạnh, và li kê cụ thể công việc: check tickets, physically guide to row and seat number

### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==helping people find their seats==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We weren't supposed to ==let them wander== or ==find seats on their own==; our priority was ==physically guiding them== and ==showing everyone their row and seat number=="..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK helping people find their seats==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "weren't supposed to X (Antonym); our priority was Y (Synonym)" đã phủ định việc để khách tự do/tự tìm (Antonyms) và khẳng định sự hướng dẫn/chỉ chỗ. 
> - Wander = Antonym of Helping find seats
> - → Physically guiding them = Helping people find their seats.
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận diện đúng vai trò khi người nói bác bỏ các trạng thái "thả lỏng/tự do" (Antonyms) để mô tả dịch vụ hỗ trợ vị trí cụ thực tế.
