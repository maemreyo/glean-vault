>
> **Context:** *Student (Finn) expressing satisfaction about their research topic choice for theatre history project*
>
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 03

> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==was not familiar to their module leader== | giáo viên hướng dẫn không biết | unfamiliar, new, unknown, unheard of | ⚠️ Medium |
> | B | ==had not been chosen by other students== | chưa có ai chọn | unique, original, nobody selected, fresh | ⚠️ Low |
> | C | ==did not prove to be difficult to research== | không khó nghiên cứu | easy to research, manageable, accessible sources | ⚠️ High |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==B. had not been chosen by other students==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Tính độc đáo của chủ đề (Uniqueness of topic)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Academic / Research / Education==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==độc nhất, chưa từng được nghiên cứu== - chủ đề mới lạ, không ai đụng đến
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==not chosen before== - chưa được chọn, chưa có người làm
>
> - **Distractor:** "easy to research" nghe giống "available information" nhưng đó là về độ khó, không phải về tính độc đáo
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==had not been chosen → nobody had selected, unique, original, fresh, untouched==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung Finn nhìn danh sách các chủ đề, tìm thấy chủ đề của mình ==chưa có ai check==
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói: *"It's completely new," "Nobody's done it," "It's fresh," "Original"*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động kiểm tra danh sách topic, thấy tên chủ đề chưa bị chọn
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: choose + topic, select + subject, pick + theme
> - `Noun + prep + Noun`: topic + for + project, subject + for + research
> - `Adj + Noun`: unique + topic, original + subject, fresh + idea

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I was pleased to find that ==no one else had chosen== this topic..."
>
> - "It was ==completely untouched== by other students..."
>
> - "Nobody had ==selected it== before..."
>
> - "The topic was ==still available==..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==was not familiar to their module leader==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Finn nói "module leader hasn't heard of it" → dễ hiểu là leader không biết topic
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Finn vui vì topic độc đáo, không phải vì leader không biết
>
> **Trap 2:** ==did not prove to be difficult to research==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Audio có thể nhắc đến "plenty of information" hoặc "sources available"
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Mặc dù dễ nghiên cứu là lợi ích, nhưng Finn vui chủ yếu vì ==topic chưa ai chọn==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "I was really pleased when I checked the list and ==nobody had chosen== our topic yet. It's completely ==original== and fresh compared to what others are doing."
>
> → **Match:** ==had not been chosen by other students==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "What made me happy was that our topic was ==still available==. No other student had ==selected it==, which means we can explore something new."
>
> → **Match:** ==had not been chosen by other students==

> **Option Text:** ==had not been chosen by other students==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "The best part was looking at the topic board and seeing that ==no other student had chosen== our topic. It's ==completely original== and fresh.

#flashcards/ielts-listening/education-training/academic-research/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==Finn was pleased to discover that their topic?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. was not familiar to their module leader** (❌) → Audio nhắc leader không biết nhưng dùng "but" để chuyển sang điểm chính
> 2. **B. had not been chosen by other students** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "nobody had chosen", "completely untouched", "still available"
> 3. **C. did not prove to be difficult to research** (❌) → Audio có thể nhắc dễ nghiên cứu nhưng chỉ như "plus" bổ sung
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng Finn nói về việc check topic list và thấy chủ đề của họ còn trống
> - Sau đó nhắc đến module leader (distractor A) nhưng dùng "but" để chuyển focus
> - Bổ sung về độ dễ nghiên cứu (distractor C) với "plus" - rõ ràng đây chỉ là lợi ích phụ
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh "what really pleased me" + multiple paraphrases cho "not chosen by others"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Familiarity và Research Difficulty được nhắc nhưng bị削弱 bởi "but" và "plus"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (nobody chosen, untouched, available, nobody's done work) converging vào cùng ý nghĩa
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Trong MCQ, tập trung vào từ chỉ ra quan điểm chính hoặc cảm xúc chủ đạo của người nói ("pleased", "really happy", "what matters")
