> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Research Quality / Information Status
> **Topic Category:** Academic / Research
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** The ==details or specifics of information provided== were ==insufficiently clear or distinct==, lacking ==necessary clarity or precision==.
> - **Denotation:** ==Too vague== means ==not specific enough==, ==lacking detail==, or ==unclear in meaning==; ==information given about this== refers to ==what was provided/conveyed== on the topic.
> - **Distractor:** Could be confused with ==information was incorrect==, ==information was complicated==, ==information was incomplete==, or ==information was unreliable==.
> - **Deep Dive:** ==Lack of specific details==, ==insufficient clarity in information==, ==ambiguous explanation provided==, ==insufficiently precise information==.

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Blurred text on a document==, ==generalized statements without specifics==, ==question marks in margins==, ==highlighted unclear sections==.
> - **Auditory:** ==Expressing confusion about meaning==, ==saying "I'm not sure what you mean"==, ==asking for clarification==, ==expressing lack of clarity==.
> - **Action:** ==Requesting more details==, ==seeking clarification==, ==expressing confusion==, ==asking for specifics==.
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==clarify== + ==information==, ==provide== + ==details==, ==specify== + ==points==, ==explain== + ==clearly==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==lack of + detail==, ==absence of + clarity==, ==insufficiency of + information==
> - `Adj + Noun`: ==vague== + ==information==, ==ambiguous== + ==explanation==, ==general== + ==details==, ==imprecise== + ==information==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "The details were rather unclear..."
> - "The explanation lacked specificity..."
> - "They didn't give us enough detail..."
> - "The information was quite general..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==The facts about this may not be reliable==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Both mention ==problems with information== but different nature.
> - *Actual meaning:* This is about ==accuracy/trustworthiness==, while option is about ==clarity/specificity== of the information.
>
> **Trap 2:** ==No useful research has been done on this==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Expresses ==insufficient information== but for different reason.
> - *Actual meaning:* This says research ==doesn't exist==, while option says information ==exists but lacks detail==.

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "I read through the briefing materials, but I have to say they didn't give us much to work with. Everything was very generalized without any specific examples or concrete details. It was difficult to understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing."
> → **Match:** ==The information given about this was too vague==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The presentation covered the topic broadly, but unfortunately, it lacked the specific information we need. The speaker gave us an overview but didn't go into any detail about procedures or requirements. We're still not sure about the exact nature of the project."
> → **Match:** ==The information given about this was too vague==

### Card 4: Reverse Matching (Thực chiến)

> **Audio Script:**
> "After reviewing the orientation materials, I have to express some concerns. While the documents covered the general concept of community volunteering, they didn't provide the specific guidance we need. There are no detailed instructions about procedures, no examples of what's expected, and the guidelines are quite broad. It's difficult to understand exactly what our responsibilities are."

> - Audio nói: =="didn't provide the specific guidance we need"== and =="guidelines are quite broad"==
>
> - Tương đương với: ==too vague==
>
> **🧠 Logic Chain:** =="no detailed instructions"== + =="no examples"== + =="broad guidelines"== = lack of specifics = ==vague information==

>
> **🧱 Key Barrier:** Distinguish between ==unclear (lacking detail) vs. unreliable (questionable accuracy)==

### Card 9: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "I've reviewed the training materials they sent over. On the positive side, there's actually quite a lot of documentation - several documents covering different aspects. However, the main issue is that everything is described in very general terms. For instance, they talk about 'assisting the community' but don't specify what activities that involves. They mention 'regular volunteering' but don't explain the frequency or duration. We really need more concrete information to understand what's expected of us."

> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** ==quite a lot of documentation...several documents==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Suggests ==sufficient information quantity==
>
> - *Wrong because:* This is about ==quantity== of documents, not ==quality/clarity== of the information within them
>
> **2. Distractor:** ==assisting the community==, ==regular volunteering==
>
> - *Sounds like:* These sound like specific details
>
> - *Wrong because:* Speaker explicitly says these are ==described in very general terms== without ==specifying== what they mean
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==The information given about this was too vague==
> - *Why correct:* Speaker emphasizes =="very general terms"==, ==doesn't specify==, and expresses need for =="more concrete information"==

### Card 10: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** =="The information given about this was too vague"==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "About the community center project guidelines, I need to point out that they're not as helpful as we'd hoped. The document gives us an overview of what volunteering involves, but it doesn't get into the specifics. It tells us we'll be 'supporting local initiatives' but doesn't explain what those initiatives are. It mentions 'various roles available' but doesn't describe what those roles actually entail. We're left with more questions than answers."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Highlight== và giải thích tất cả các ==paraphrases== từ Audio → Option?
?
> [!example] 🎯 Paraphrase Mapping
> - ==doesn't get into the specifics== → ==too vague==
>
> - ==doesn't explain what those initiatives are== → ==lacks detail==
>
> - ==doesn't describe what those roles actually entail== → ==insufficiently specific==
>
> - ==more questions than answers== → ==information unclear==
>
> **🧠 Overall Logic:** Audio repeatedly emphasizes ==lack of specific information== through multiple examples of ==missing details==
