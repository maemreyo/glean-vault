> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Hành động
> **Topic Category:** Volunteering
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Tiếp cận, ==liên hệ== với các ==doanh nghiệp trong khu vực== để tìm kiếm sự hỗ trợ hoặc hợp tác
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là việc ==gọi điện, gửi email, gặp mặt== các công ty/cửa hàng địa phương để ==thảo luận, thương lượng, xin tài trợ==
> - **Distractor:** ==talking to local people== (nói chuyện với người dân địa phương - quá rộng), ==working in local shops== (làm việc ở cửa hàng - hành động khác)
> - **Deep Dive:** ==reaching out to local companies==, ==getting in touch with area merchants==, ==approaching local enterprises==, ==engaging with neighborhood businesses==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Đang gọi điện thoại==, ==gõ email trên máy tính==, ==cầm danh thiếp==, ==cầm tài liệu tài trợ==, đi bộ ==qua các cửa hàng==
> - **Auditory:** "Hi, I'm calling from the community center...", "We'd like to discuss a potential partnership...", tiếng ==quay số điện thoại==, tiếng ==gõ bàn phím==
> - **Action:** ==Gọi điện==, ==gửi email==, ==viết thư==, ==đến gặp mặt==, ==thuyết phục==, ==xin tài trợ==
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==contact businesses==, ==approach companies==, ==reach out to merchants==, ==get in touch with enterprises==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==list of businesses==, ==directory of local companies==

> - "I spend a lot of time getting in touch with businesses"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==working with local people==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe ==gần giống== vì "businesses" cũng là "people" nhưng narrow hơn
> - *Actual meaning:* "Businesses" chỉ ==doanh nghiệp/công ty==, không phải bất kỳ người dân nào
>
> **Trap 2:** ==buying from local shops==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cũng có từ ==local shops== và "local"
> - *Actual meaning:* Đây là hành động ==mua sắm== chứ không phải ==liên hệ/tiếp cận== để hợp tác

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "One of my key responsibilities is building relationships with businesses in our community. I spend time calling up local shops, cafes, and restaurants to ask if they'd like to sponsor our events or donate items for raffles. I also visit some of the companies in person to explain our community center's mission and see if they're interested in partnership opportunities. It's all about making connections."
> → **Match:** ==contacting local businesses==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "I handle the business outreach for our volunteer program. My typical day involves looking through the directory of local enterprises, drafting emails to companies introducing our center, and following up with phone calls. I'm trying to get local businesses involved in our community initiatives, whether through sponsorship, donations, or employee volunteering programs. Last week, I secured two new sponsors!"

Tôi đã xây dựng mối quan hệ với một số chủ cửa hàng hiện thường xuyên hỗ trợ các hoạt động cộng đồng của chúng tôi.

> "We have different volunteer teams here. Some people focus on individual volunteers, recruiting them from the community and training them.

We identify local businesses and companies, then reach out to them through phone calls, emails, and in-person visits. We explain our center's mission and ask if they'd like to sponsor our events or donate products. It's challenging but rewarding work."
