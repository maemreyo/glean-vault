> [!info] Option Profile
> **Option Letter:** ==E==
> **Option Text:** ==provide publicity about a council service==
> **Context:** *Volunteering at community center*
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 02

> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Hành động
> **Topic Category:** Volunteering
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Tạo sự ==quảng bá, phổ biến== thông tin về ==dịch vụ của hội đồng địa phương== để người dân biết và sử dụng
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là việc ==tuyên truyền, quảng cáo, lan tỏa== thông tin về ==các dịch vụ, chương trình, tiện ích== mà council cung cấp
> - **Distractor:** ==telling people about services== (nói với người về dịch vụ - quá đơn giản, không có tính "quảng bá"), ==working for the council== (làm việc cho hội đồng - khác với cung cấp publicity)
> - **Deep Dive:** ==promoting council services==, ==raising awareness about government programs==, ==advertising council facilities==, ==publicizing municipal services==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Phát tờ rơi==, ==dán poster==, ==thiết kế banner==, ==đứng tại quầy thông tin==, ==cầm tài liệu quảng cáo==
> - **Auditory:** "Let me tell you about...", "We offer this service...", "Have you heard of...", "This council service provides..."
> - **Action:** ==Phát tờ rơi==, ==dán poster==, ==nói chuyện với người dân==, ==trình bày về dịch vụ==, ==quảng cáo==
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==provide publicity==, ==raise awareness==, ==promote services==, ==publicize facilities==, ==advertise programs==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==promotion of services==, ==awareness of programs==
> - `Adj + Noun`: ==council service==, ==government program==, ==municipal facility==, ==local authority service==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I'm in charge of providing publicity about council services"
> - "My job involves promoting council services to the community"
> - "I raise awareness about what the council offers"
> - "I help publicize council programs and facilities"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==telling people about services==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe ==gần giống== vì cũng là cung cấp thông tin
> - *Actual meaning:* "Telling" chỉ là ==giao tiếp cơ bản==, "providing publicity" là ==hoạt động quảng bá có tổ chức, quy mô hơn==
>
> **Trap 2:** ==explaining services==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cũng là ==giải thích== về dịch vụ
> - *Actual meaning:* "Explaining" tập trung vào ==làm rõ chi tiết==, còn "publicity" tập trung vào ==lan tỏa thông tin đến nhiều người==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "One of my key responsibilities is making sure people know about the various services our council provides. I prepare information materials, distribute flyers, and set up information displays at the community center. When people come in, I tell them about council programs like free language classes, employment assistance, and recreational facilities. I also visit local schools and community groups to give presentations about these services. The goal is to ensure everyone is aware of and can access the support available to them."
> → **Match:** ==provide publicity about a council service==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "I handle the promotional activities for our local council's services. My day involves designing posters and brochures that explain what services are available, where to find them, and who qualifies. I spend time speaking to community members, answering their questions about council programs, and encouraging them to make use of these resources. I also manage our social media channels where we share information about new initiatives. Essentially, I'm the voice that ensures people know what the council has to offer."
> → **Match:** ==provide publicity about a council service==

### Card 9: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "We have various volunteer roles here. Some volunteers help directly with running services, like staffing reception or organizing activities.

Without proper publicity, many people wouldn't even know these services exist, so my work is crucial for accessibility."
