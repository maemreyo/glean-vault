> [!info] Option Profile
> **Option Letter:** ==A==
> **Option Text:** ==It will be easy to find facts about this==
> **Context:** *Volunteering at community center*
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 02

> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Research Quality / Information Availability
> **Topic Category:** Academic / Research
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Accessing ==factual information== will be ==straightforward and uncomplicated==, requiring minimal effort or specialized resources.
> - **Denotation:** The word ==easy== suggests ==low difficulty== in ==locating data==; ==find facts== indicates ==discovering factual details== or ==gathering information==.
> - **Distractor:** Could be confused with ==difficult to find==, ==hard to locate==, ==challenging research==, or ==requires extensive investigation==.
> - **Deep Dive:** ==Straightforward to gather data==, ==simple to source information==, ==no obstacles in obtaining facts==, ==readily available information sources==.

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Browsing through well-organized library shelves==, ==scrolling through search results on a computer screen==, ==looking at clearly labeled folders in a filing cabinet==.
> - **Auditory:** ==Typing on a keyboard==, ==clicking mouse buttons==, ==pages turning in a book==, ==discussing information with colleagues==.
> - **Action:** ==Searching through archives==, ==browsing online databases==, ==consulting reference materials==, ==gathering relevant data points==.
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==gather== + ==information==, ==collect== + ==data==, ==access== + ==facts==, ==find== + ==details==, ==source== + ==materials==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==availability of + data==, ==access to + information==, ==source of + facts==
> - `Adj + Noun`: ==readily available== + ==facts==, ==easily accessible== + ==information==, ==straightforward== + ==research==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "The information is readily available..."
> - "We won't have any trouble finding the facts..."
> - "Data on this topic is quite accessible..."
> - "There are plenty of sources we can consult..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==No useful research has been done on this==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Both mention ==research/facts== but with ==opposite evaluation== of availability.
> - *Actual meaning:* This says ==information doesn't exist== or ==hasn't been conducted==, while the option states ==facts exist and are easy to find==.
>
> **Trap 2:** ==The facts about this may not be reliable==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Focuses on ==facts== but questions their ==quality== rather than ==accessibility==.
> - *Actual meaning:* This is about ==accuracy/trustworthiness==, not about ==how easy it is to find== them.

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "For this topic, you're in luck. We have an extensive archive at the local library and several online databases with comprehensive records. You won't need to look far to find what you need."
> → **Match:** ==It will be easy to find facts about this==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "There's actually a wealth of information available on this subject. The council published detailed reports last year, and various studies have been conducted. Everything you need should be quite straightforward to locate."
> → **Match:** ==It will be easy to find facts about this==

### Card 9: Full Distractor Analysis
