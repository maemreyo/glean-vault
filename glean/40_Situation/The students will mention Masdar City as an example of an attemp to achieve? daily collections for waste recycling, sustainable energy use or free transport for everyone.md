?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Audio begins with students discussing various aspects of Masdar City (waste management, transport)
> - Then shifts to the MAIN POINT using signals like "primarily an example of," "the real achievement is," "both agreed that"
> - Confirms the answer with multiple energy-related paraphrases: "renewable energy sources," "carbon-neutral," "solar power," "green energy infrastructure"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Waste and transport are mentioned as incidental features ("nice feature," "noted"), but audio uses focus signals to direct attention away from these toward ENERGY
> - **Confirmation Logic:** "Example of" + energy vocabulary (renewable, carbon-neutral, solar, green) + agreement signals ("both agreed") = correct answer
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When questions ask what speakers "mention as an example of," listen for purpose-focused language that identifies the MAIN point, not just all topics discussed
