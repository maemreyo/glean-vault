> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Hành động==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Volunteering== at ==Festivals==

> - **Definition:** The ==responsibility of promoting and facilitating collaborative relationships== between different organizations and groups in the local community
>

>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS Listening, role/duty questions often involve ==action-oriented language== such as "responsible for", "in charge of", "job involves", "tasked with", or "your role will be". Listen for the relational nature of the task - "cooperation" and "between organisations" indicates fostering mutual relationships among groups

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Volunteers ==bringing together representatives from different organizations==, facilitating meetings, helping groups work together
>
> - **Auditory:** Coordinator saying "You'll be encouraging cooperation" or "Your job involves fostering partnerships"
>
> - **Action:** Organizing joint activities, facilitating communication between groups, helping organizations collaborate
>
