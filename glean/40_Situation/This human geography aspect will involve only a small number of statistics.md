> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Đặc điểm phương pháp/Lượng dữ liệu== của nghiên cứu (Methodology characteristic / Data quantity)
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Academic Research / Data Collection / Research Planning==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** ==Involve only a small number of statistics== refers to a research project or study that uses minimal quantitative data, limited numerical findings, or few statistical measures to support conclusions
>
> - **Denotation:** Direct meaning includes: limited data availability, few statistics to analyze, minimal quantitative information, scarce numerical data, restricted statistical findings
>
> - **Distractor:** Similar phrases include "not accurate," "too complex," "hard to understand," "not useful" - these express quality or difficulty, not ==quantity/amount==
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS context, speakers may paraphrase "small number of statistics" as: "limited data," "few statistics available," "minimal data points," "not many numerical findings," "scarce statistical information," "restricts us to just a few statistics"

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Looking at a research report with sparse tables, a few scattered data points on graphs, empty or minimal statistical charts
>
> - **Auditory:** Hearing expressions like "we only have a few figures," "the data is limited," "there aren't many statistics available," "we're restricted to minimal data"
>
> - **Action:** Researchers examining empty data tables, students noting limited information in reports, pointing out sparse numerical findings
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Adjective + number of`: small, limited, few, minimal, restricted, low
>
> - `Verb + number`: involve, contain, have, provide, yield, generate
>
> - `Number + of + noun`: statistics, data points, figures, numerical findings, data

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "There's only a ==limited amount of data== available."
>
> - "We won't have many ==statistics to work with==."
>
> - "The study involves ==very few data points==."
>
> - "We're restricted to a ==small number of statistics==."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==statistics are not accurate==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Research discussions often question data quality, and "not accurate" sounds like a concern about statistics
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The issue is AMOUNT/QUANTITY of data, not ACCURACY - "small number" indicates scarcity, not inaccuracy
>
> **Trap 2:** ==too many statistics to analyze==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Statistical analysis often involves complex datasets, and "too many" could seem like a problem
>
> - *Actual meaning:* This suggests OPPOSITE of what's stated - "small number" means too FEW, not too MANY

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "When they examined the human geography aspect, they found it would involve only a small number of statistics. As one student noted, 'There aren't many data points available for us to analyze.'"
>
> → **Match:** ==involve only a small number of statistics==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The students discussed that this particular aspect is limited in terms of data. One explained that they'd have to work with very few statistics, as there isn't much quantitative information available."
>
> → **Match:** ==involve only a small number of statistics==

### Card 15: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "The students discussed various concerns about the human geography aspect. One worried that the ==statistics might not be accurate==, while another was concerned that there would be ==too many statistics to analyze==. However, they concluded that the real issue is that the research will involve ==only a small number of statistics==. As one explained, 'We're limited by the fact that there are very few data points available,' while the other confirmed they'd have to work with minimal statistical information."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** ==statistics might not be accurate==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Valid research concern about data quality
>
> - *Wrong because:* This is about ACCURACY/QUALITY, but the speakers focus on AMOUNT/QUANTITY - discussion shifts away from accuracy to quantity
>
> **2. Distractor:** ==too many statistics to analyze==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Concern about overwhelming data, which is realistic for research
>
> - *Wrong because:* This is OPPOSITE of what's stated - "small number" means too FEW, not too many; "only a small number" clearly indicates insufficiency
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==involve only a small number of statistics==
> - *Why correct:* "real issue is" + "limited by the fact" + "very few data points" + "minimal statistical information" = clear focus on quantity limitation

### Card 16: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** ==involve only a small number of statistics==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "When evaluating the human geography research aspect, the students identified several potential challenges. Initially, one student was concerned that the ==statistics might not be accurate==, and another worried there would be ==too many statistics to analyze==. However, after reviewing available data, they agreed that the real constraint is that the research will involve ==only a small number of statistics==. One emphasized they're ==limited by very few data points==, while the other confirmed they'd have to work with ==minimal statistical information== and ==scarce numerical findings==."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Highlight== và giải thích tất cả các ==paraphrases== từ Audio → Option?
?
> [!example] 🎯 Paraphrase Mapping
> - ==limited by very few data points== → involve only a small number of statistics (limited by = only, very few = small number, data points = statistics)
>
> - ==work with minimal statistical information== → involve only a small number of statistics (work with = involve, minimal = small/limited, statistical information = statistics)
>
> - ==scarce numerical findings== → involve only a small number of statistics (scarce = limited/small, numerical findings = statistics)
>
> **🧠 Overall Logic:** Multiple paraphrases for quantity limitation confirm answer; initial concerns (accuracy, too many) are dismissed in favor of "too few" issue
