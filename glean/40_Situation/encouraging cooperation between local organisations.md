> **Context:** *Volunteering at community center*
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 02

> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Hành động
> **Topic Category:** Volunteering
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Khuyến khích, thúc đẩy sự ==hợp tác== giữa các ==tổ chức trong khu vực== để cùng nhau làm việc hiệu quả hơn
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là việc ==thuyết phục, cổ vũ== các nhóm/tổ chức ==làm việc chung==, ==chia sẻ tài nguyên==, ==hỗ trợ lẫn nhau==
> - **Distractor:** ==working with organisations== (làm việc với tổ chức - đơn phương, không phải "giữa"), ==talking to organisations== (nói chuyện với tổ chức - quá đơn giản)
> - **Deep Dive:** ==fostering collaboration among groups==, ==promoting teamwork between organisations==, ==building partnerships with community groups==, ==facilitating joint efforts among organizations==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Tổ chức cuộc họp== với nhiều tổ chức, ==trình bày slide== về hợp tác, ==bắt tay== giữa đại diện các tổ chức, ==ký hợp đồng==
> - **Auditory:** "Let's work together on this...", "We can share resources...", "Collaboration is key...", "How about we partner up...", tiếng ==thảo luận sôi nổi==
> - **Action:** ==Sắp xếp cuộc họp==, ==trình bày ý tưởng==, ==đàm phán==, ==thuyết phục==, ==xây dựng mối quan hệ==
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==encourage cooperation==, ==promote collaboration==, ==foster partnership==, ==facilitate teamwork==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==spirit of cooperation==, ==sense of partnership==
> - `Adj + Noun`: ==local organisations==, ==community groups==, ==area institutions==, ==neighbourhood organisations==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I'm in charge of encouraging cooperation between local organisations"
> - "My job involves fostering collaboration among community groups"
> - "I work on bringing different organisations together"
> - "I promote teamwork and cooperation between local groups"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==working with organisations==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe ==gần giống== vì làm việc với tổ chức là bước trước khi hợp tác
> - *Actual meaning:* "Working with" có thể là ==đơn phương==, còn "cooperation between" nhấn mạnh ==hai chiều - tổ chức với nhau==
>
> **Trap 2:** ==talking to organisations==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cũng là ==giao tiếp== với các tổ chức
> - *Actual meaning:* "Talking" chỉ là ==giao tiếp cơ bản==, "encouraging cooperation" là ==thúc đẩy hành động cụ thể - làm việc chung==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "My role is about building bridges between different community groups. I regularly organize meetings with representatives from various local organisations - schools, charities, sports clubs, and cultural groups. At these meetings, I encourage them to work together on shared projects and initiatives. For example, I helped bring together a school and a local charity to run an after-school program. It's rewarding to see organisations collaborating instead of working in isolation."
> → **Match:** ==encouraging cooperation between local organisations==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "I focus on partnership development within our community. There are so many local organisations doing great work, but they often operate independently. My job is to connect them and show them the benefits of cooperation. I facilitate joint planning sessions, help them share resources, and coordinate collaborative events. Last month, I convinced three different organisations to work together on a community festival, which turned out to be much more successful than if they'd done it separately."
> → **Match:** ==encouraging cooperation between local organisations==

### Card 7: Context Cloze (Điền từ)

> 🗣️ **Audio Transcript:**

> 🇻🇳 **Vietnamese:** Tôi rất nhiệt tình với việc khuyến khích sự hợp tác giữa các tổ chức trong khu vực của chúng tôi. Tôi kết nối các trường học, tổ chức từ thiện, câu lạc bộ thể thao và các nhóm văn hóa để làm việc trên các dự án chung. Thay vì hoạt động cô lập, tôi khuyến khích họ chia sẻ nguồn lực và hợp tác trong các sáng kiến mang lại lợi ích cho cả cộng đồng. Khi họ hợp tác, mọi người đều thắng.

### Card 9: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "There are several aspects to our volunteer work. Some volunteers focus on recruiting individual members from the community. Others manage the day-to-day operations and programs. My specific area is relationship building across the organisational landscape. I work with multiple local organisations simultaneously - schools, charities, sports clubs, arts groups - and bring them together for collaborative projects. I coordinate joint events, facilitate resource-sharing agreements, and encourage partnerships that strengthen our entire community network. The impact of organisations working together is much greater than each working alone."

>
> **2. Distractor:** =="managing day-to-day operations"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Cũng là làm việc ==hàng ngày== với community
>
> - *Wrong because:* Quản lý ==vận hành== của center, không phải ==thúc đẩy hợp tác giữa các tổ chức==
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==encouraging cooperation between local organisations==
> - *Why correct:* Nghe ==work with multiple local organisations== + ==bring them together for collaborative projects== + ==coordinate joint events / facilitate resource-sharing / encourage partnerships==

### Card 10: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** =="encouraging cooperation between local organisations"==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "My passion is creating synergy in our community. I've noticed that many local organisations - charities, schools, sports clubs, cultural groups - tend to operate separately. My volunteer role is about changing that. I actively encourage these groups to collaborate rather than compete. I organise networking events where representatives from different organisations can meet and discuss potential joint initiatives. I facilitate partnerships and help them see the benefits of sharing resources and expertise. When they work together on community projects, the outcomes are so much more impactful. It's about building bridges and fostering a spirit of cooperation that benefits everyone."
