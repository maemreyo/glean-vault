>
> - **Auditory:** ==asking for opinions, hearing feedback, discussing event experiences, recording comments==

>
> - *Why it's tricky:* ==Relates to feedback processing after collection==
>
> - *Actual meaning:* ==This happens AFTER collection, not the collection itself - volunteers are analyzing/talking about feedback, not gathering it from attendees==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "For this volunteer role, you'll be based around the event areas collecting feedback on events. We'll give you some questionnaires and you'll approach visitors to get their opinions on what they thought of the different activities."
>
> → **Match:** ==collecting feedback on events==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "What your role involves is gathering responses from attendees. You'll be collecting feedback throughout the day - asking people what they enjoyed, what could be improved, and noting down their comments about the various events."
>
> → **Match:** ==collecting feedback on events==

### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==collecting feedback on events==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We weren't supposed to ==ignore opinions== or ==dismiss what visitors had to say==; instead, the job was ==gathering responses== and ==getting their honest feedback==..."*

> - Ignore opinions = Antonym of Collecting feedback
> - → Gathering responses = Collecting feedback.
>
