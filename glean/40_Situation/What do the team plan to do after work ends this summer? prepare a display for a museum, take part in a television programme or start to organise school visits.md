> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Hành động / Kế hoạch tương lai== (Future plans)
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Education / Archaeology / Community Outreach==
>
> **🧠 6D Framework (Logic & Lexical):**
> - **Definition:** Hành động ==tổ chức các chuyến tham quan== cho học sinh đến địa điểm khai quật học, nhằm mục đích giáo dục và lan tỏa kiến thức.
> - **Denotation Nghĩa đen:** Thuê nhân sự, liên hệ với các trường học, thiết kế lịch trình tham quan, chuẩn bị tài liệu hướng dẫn cho học sinh đến thăm địa điểm archaeological.
> - **Distractor:** Những từ nghe giống nhưng KHÔNG PHẢI: "museum display" (lưu trữ hiện vật tại bảo tàng, không phải đưa học sinh đến), "TV programme" (quảng bá qua truyền thông, không phải giáo dục trực tiếp).
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing sâu hơn: ==organise educational visits → coordinate trips for schools, arrange tours for local students, set up school excursions to the site==
>
> - **Antonyms (Logic Flip):** Các từ/cấu trúc phủ định hoặc đối lập hoàn toàn: ==cancel school trips, discontinue educational outreach, private excavation only, restricted access, end student involvement==
>
> - **Synonym Chain (Verbs):**
>   - ==organise/arrange== → Syn: ==coordinate, schedule, systematize== | Ant: ==disorganize, mess up, confuse==
>   - ==visit/tour== → Syn: ==explore, inspect, frequent== | Ant: ==avoid, shun, ignore==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers (Verb-Focused):**
>
> - **Visual:** Nhìn thấy ==nhóm học sinh== mặc đồng phục trường đang đi dọc theo khu khai quật, với cuốn sổ tay ghi chép (notebooks) và camera chụp ảnh hiện vật
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe tiếng ==giải thích hướng dẫn viên== (guide's explanation) nói về lịch sử ngôi làng cổ, tiếng cười đùa của học sinh (students' laughter), tiếng bước chân trên đường mòn (footsteps on trails)
>
> - **Action:** Hành động cụ thể: ==liên hệ hiệu trưởng== (contacting principals), gửi email mời tham quan (emailing invitations), chuẩn bị biển chỉ dẫn (preparing signposts), huấn luyện hướng dẫn viên (training guides)
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: organise + school visits, arrange + educational trips, coordinate + excursions
>
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: organisation of + visits, arrangement of + tours
>
> - `Adj + Noun`: educational + visits, school + trips, local + schools

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "Our next step is to..."
>
> - "We're planning to organise..."
>
> - "The focus will be on..."
>
> - "We want to involve local schools..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==prepare a display for a museum==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì các dự án archaeology thường có kết quả là hiện vật, và "display" là từ phổ biến khi nói về triển lãm.
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Đây là việc ==đưa hiện vật vào bảo tàng== để lưu trữ/trưng bày, không phải hoạt động giáo dục trực tiếp.
>
> **Trap 2:** ==take part in a television programme==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì nhiều dự án archaeology được quảng bá qua TV và từ "programme" xuất hiện trong câu hỏi.
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Đây là ==phương tiện truyền thông== quảng bá dự án, không phải kế hoạch cụ thể sau khi kết thúc công việc.

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Well, now that the excavation is drawing to a close, we've been discussing our next steps. The museum in town has offered to host some of our finds, but we're thinking bigger than that. We really want to share this discovery with the younger generation, so we're hoping to start organising visits for local schools to come and see the site for themselves."
>
> → **Match:** ==start to organise school visits==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The team has been brainstorming about post-project activities. One idea was to create a permanent display, but we felt that wouldn't reach enough people. We also considered doing a documentary, but that's quite expensive. So we've decided our priority should be educational outreach - we'll be working with nearby schools to arrange field trips to the excavation site next term."
>
> → **Match:** ==start to organise school visits==

### Card 6: Trap Identification (Spot the Lie)

> **Option:** ==prepare a display for a museum==
>
> ❓ **Reflex Drill:** Nếu Audio nói: *"The museum has offered to host some of our finds..."* → **Số phận** option này thế nào?
?
> [!fail] 🛑 Spot the Lie
> **👉 Verdict:** ==LOẠI NGAY== (False)
>
> **⚠️ Why? (Trap Signal):**

### Card 15: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "Well, we've got a few ideas for after the excavation wraps up. The local museum did suggest they could put on a display of some of the artifacts we found. And there's been some talk about doing a television documentary, though that would require quite a bit of funding. But what we're most excited about is bringing in local schools - we think giving children the chance to see an actual archaeological site would be really educational. So we'll be setting up visits for them next term."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** =="prepare a display for a museum"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Audio nói "museum did suggest" và "put on a display"
>
> - *Wrong because:* Đây là "suggestion" từ bên ngoài, bị "but" phủ định, team chọn hướng "most excited about" khác.
>
> **2. Distractor:** =="take part in a television programme"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Audio nhắc "television documentary"
>
> - *Wrong because:* Bị loại bỏ vì lý do thực tế ("would require quite a bit of funding"), không phải kế hoạch ưu tiên.
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==start to organise school visits==
> - *Why correct:* Được xác nhận bởi "most excited about", "bringing in local schools", "setting up visits" - rõ ràng là ưu tiên chính.

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==What do the team plan to do after work ends this summer?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. prepare a display for a museum** (❌) → Đề xuất từ bảo tàng, bị phủ định bằng "but", không phải ưu tiên.
>
> 2. **B. take part in a television programme** (❌) → Được nhắc nhưng bị loại vì lý do tài chính ("expensive"), không phải kế hoạch thực sự.
>
> 3. **C. start to organise school visits** (✅) → Được xác nhận là "most excited about", "our priority", cụ thể với "working with schools", "setting up visits".
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Mô tả chi tiết luồng thông tin: Bắt đầu bằng việc đề cập ý tưởng trưng bày bảo tàng, sau đó dùng signal "but" chuyển sang ý tưởng TV, và dùng "most excited about/priority" để chốt đáp án là hoạt động giáo dục với trường học.
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Phân tích kỹ thuật gài bẫy: đề xuất từ bên ngoài (museum) ≠ kế hoạch team; ý tưởng TV bị loại vì lý do thực tế.
>
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Phân tích sự khớp nối chính xác giữa Audio và Đáp án đúng: "most excited about" + "bringing in schools" + "setting up visits" = "organise school visits".
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Bài học rút ra về kỹ năng làm bài: Luôn lắng nghe signal từ phủ định ("but", "however") để xác định đáp án thực sự. Tìm từ nhấn mạnh như "priority", "most excited" để xác định phương án được chọn.

#flashcards/ielts-listening/cam-20-test-3/science-tech/archaeology/biweekly/06-logic-flip
### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==start to organise school visits==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We were worried we'd have to ==restrict access== or ==cancel the educational program== due to safety, but we found a way so we ==won't have to stop school trips== after all..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK C (Start to organise school visits)==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "worried we'd have to X but found a way so we won't have to Y" (X = restrict/cancel, Y = stop school trips) đã phủ định việc dừng (Antonym) và khẳng định việc tiếp tục/bắt đầu (organise visits). 
> - Stop visits = Antonym of Start/Organise visits
> - → Won't have to stop = Will continue/start to organise.
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận diện kế hoạch thực sự ngay cả khi người nói mô tả rủi ro "bị hủy/hạn chế" (Antonyms) trước khi xác nhận thực hiện.
