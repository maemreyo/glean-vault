> [!info] 📋 Question Profile
> **Question Type:** ==multi==
>
> **Question Stem:** ==Maya doesn't fully understand why, in the 20th century, very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA; British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long or theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> **Context:** *Student (Maya) discussing historical development of theatre programmes in different countries*
>
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 03

> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA== | rất ít programme được in tại Mỹ | scarce production, limited printing | ⚠️ High |
> | B | ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long== | programme Anh phát triển chậm | stagnated, lagged behind, didn't progress | ⚠️ Medium |
> | C | ==theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA== | programme Anh sao chép Mỹ | imitated, copied American style, followed trends | ⚠️ Low |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==B. British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Quá trình phát triển (Development process)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==History / Cultural Evolution / Comparison==
>
> **🧠 6D Framework (Logic & Lexical):**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==không phát triển/đứng yên trong thời gian dài== - thiếu đổi mới, tiến bộ chậm
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==failed to develop = không phát triển được== - không có sự cải thiện hay đổi mới
>
> - **Distractor:** "copied fashions" nghe giống "influenced by" nhưng đó là hoạt động tích cực (coppying), không phải thiếu phát triển
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==failed to develop → stagnated, didn't progress, lagged behind, remained unchanged, slow development==
>
> - **Antonyms (Logic Flip):** Các từ/cấu trúc phủ định hoặc đối lập hoàn toàn: ==thrived, evolved rapidly, innovative leap, progressed quickly, transformed, advanced==
>
> - **Synonym Chain (Verbs):**
>   - ==fail/neglect== → Syn: ==miss out, omit, bypass== | Ant: ==succeed, achieve, attain==
>   - ==develop/evolve== → Syn: ==progress, advance, grow== | Ant: ==stagnate, regress, stop==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers (Verb-Focused):**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung các chương trình nhà hát qua nhiều thế kỷ trông giống hệt nhau (visually identical), thiếu sự đổi mới về màu sắc và bố cục (lack of layout innovation)
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói nhấn mạnh bằng tone giọng bối rối/hoài nghi: *"They ==stayed the same== for decades," *"They ==didn't change==," *"There was ==no progress=="*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động so sánh programme cũ (19th) và mới (20th) thấy không có sự tiến hóa (no evolution), cảm giác như giậm chân tại chỗ (running in place)
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + to + V`: fail + to + develop, manage + to + progress
> - `Noun + prep + Noun`: development + of + programmes, fashion + from + USA
> - `Adj + Noun`: British + theatre, American + style, long + period

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "They ==didn't really progress== for a long time..."
>
> - "There was ==little development==..."
>
> - "They ==stayed the same== for decades..."
>
> - "They ==lagged behind== in terms of innovation..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "Copied fashions" nghe giống "influenced by" - có thể hiểu là phát triển nhờ học hỏi
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Coppying là hành động tích cực, còn "failed to develop" là thiếu tiến bộ - Maya bối rối vì có chương trình phát triển (nhờ copy) nhưng vẫn "failed to develop"
>
> **Trap 2:** ==very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Đây là một điểm thật, nhưng Maya bối rối là tại sao programme Anh "failed to develop"
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Maya đang so sánh hai hiện tượng - Mỹ có ít programme nhưng Anh có nhiều song lại "failed to develop"

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "What I don't quite get is why British programmes ==didn't develop== for such a long period. They just ==stayed stagnant== while American ones, though fewer, were more innovative."
>
> → **Match:** ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "It's puzzling that in the 20th century, theatre programmes in Britain ==failed to progress==. They ==lagged behind== in terms of development compared to other countries."
>
> → **Match:** ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==

#flashcards/ielts-listening/cam-20-test-3/culture-media/theatre-development/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==Maya doesn't fully understand why, in the 20th century, very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA; British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long or theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA** (❌) → Audio có thể nhắc "American programmes scarce" nhưng dùng "But" để chuyển focus
> 2. **B. British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged, real issue is..."
> 3. **C. theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA** (❌) → Audio thừa nhận có copy nhưng làm rõ đó không phải điểm bối rối chính
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng Maya nói về sự bối rối/puzzled
> - Nhắc đến các điểm khác như USA scarce programmes và British copying American styles (context, distractors A, C)
> - Sau đó dùng signal "But the real issue is" hoặc "key problem is" để chuyển sang điểm chính
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh "stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged" - paraphrase cho failed to develop
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** USA scarcity và British copying được nhắc như background, bị削弱 bởi "But the real issue is", "key problem is"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged) converging vào cùng ý nghĩa - lack of development
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Trong MCQ về cause/reason for confusion, tập trung vào từ chỉ ra điểm chính/mối quan tâm thực sự ("the real issue", "key problem", "main question", "puzzling thing")

?
> [!info] 📊 Classification Result
> 1. ==stayed stagnant for decades== → ==[✅]== (Paraphrase trực tiếp của failed to develop)
> 2. ==American programmes were relatively scarce== → ==[⚠️]== (Bẫy chủ thể, thông tin về Mỹ không phải về sự phát triển của Anh)
> 3. ==they didn't really progress or evolve== → ==[✅]== (Đặc điểm của việc thiếu phát triển)
> 4. ==evolved rapidly during the 20th century== → ==[❌]== (Ngược lại với failed to develop)
> 5. ==remained largely unchanged== → ==[✅]== (Trạng thái đứng yên)
> 6. ==copied American fashions at times== → ==[⚠️]== (Bẫy hành động, nhắc đến sự học hỏi nhưng không phải là thiếu phát triển)
> 7. ==lagged behind in terms of innovation== → ==[✅]== (Phát triển chậm hơn đối thủ)
> 8. ==underwent a major transformation== → ==[❌]== (Logic đảo chiều: thay đổi lớn)
> 9. ==little to no development seen== → ==[✅]== (Paraphrase của failed to develop)
> 10. ==innovative designs appeared quickly== → ==[❌]== (Trái ngược với sự trì trệ)

#flashcards/ielts-listening/cam-20-test-3/culture-media/theatre-development/biweekly/06-logic-flip
### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"People expected them to ==evolve rapidly== or ==transform== like the American versions, but surprisingly they ==didn't do that at all==..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK B (failed to develop)==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "expected to X but didn't do X at all" (X = evolve/transform) đã phủ định sự kỳ vọng về tiến bộ, khẳng định tình trạng đứng yên (Antonym của evolve). 
> - Antonyms of stagnate = evolve/transform
> - → Didn't evolve/transform = Stagnate (Failed to develop).
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận biết đáp án khi người nói phủ định các kỳ vọng về sự thay đổi/tiến bộ (Antonyms) để mô tả thực tế trì trệ.
