> [!info] 📋 Question Profile
> **Question Type:** ==multi==
>
> **Question Stem:** ==Maya doesn't fully understand why, in the 20th century, very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA; British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long or theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> **Context:** *Student (Maya) discussing historical development of theatre programmes in different countries*
>
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 03

> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA== | rất ít programme được in tại Mỹ | scarce production, limited printing | ⚠️ High |
> | B | ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long== | programme Anh phát triển chậm | stagnated, lagged behind, didn't progress | ⚠️ Medium |
> | C | ==theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA== | programme Anh sao chép Mỹ | imitated, copied American style, followed trends | ⚠️ Low |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==B. British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Quá trình phát triển (Development process)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==History / Cultural Evolution / Comparison==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==không phát triển/đứng yên trong thời gian dài== - thiếu đổi mới, tiến bộ chậm
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==failed to develop = không phát triển được== - không có sự cải thiện hay đổi mới
>
> - **Distractor:** "copied fashions" nghe giống "influenced by" nhưng đó là hoạt động tích cực (coppying), không phải thiếu phát triển
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==failed to develop → stagnated, didn't progress, lagged behind, remained unchanged, slow development==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung các chương trình nhà hát qua nhiều thế kỷ trông giống nhau, thiếu sự đổi mới
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói: *"They ==stayed the same== for decades," *"They ==didn't change==," *"There was ==no progress=="*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động so sánh programme cũ và mới thấy không khác biệt
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + to + V`: fail + to + develop, manage + to + progress
> - `Noun + prep + Noun`: development + of + programmes, fashion + from + USA
> - `Adj + Noun`: British + theatre, American + style, long + period

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "They ==didn't really progress== for a long time..."
>
> - "There was ==little development==..."
>
> - "They ==stayed the same== for decades..."
>
> - "They ==lagged behind== in terms of innovation..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "Copied fashions" nghe giống "influenced by" - có thể hiểu là phát triển nhờ học hỏi
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Coppying là hành động tích cực, còn "failed to develop" là thiếu tiến bộ - Maya bối rối vì có chương trình phát triển (nhờ copy) nhưng vẫn "failed to develop"
>
> **Trap 2:** ==very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Đây là một điểm thật, nhưng Maya bối rối là tại sao programme Anh "failed to develop"
>
> * *Actual meaning:* Maya đang so sánh hai hiện tượng - Mỹ có ít programme nhưng Anh có nhiều song lại "failed to develop"

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "What I don't quite get is why British programmes ==didn't develop== for such a long period. They just ==stayed stagnant== while American ones, though fewer, were more innovative."
>
> → **Match:** ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "It's puzzling that in the 20th century, theatre programmes in Britain ==failed to progress==. They ==lagged behind== in terms of development compared to other countries."
>
> → **Match:** ==British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long==

### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==Maya doesn't fully understand why, in the 20th century, very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA; British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long or theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. very few theatre programmes were printed in the USA** (❌) → Audio có thể nhắc "American programmes scarce" nhưng dùng "But" để chuyển focus
> 2. **B. British theatre programmes failed to develop for so long** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged, real issue is..."
> 3. **C. theatre programmes in Britain copied fashions from the USA** (❌) → Audio thừa nhận có copy nhưng làm rõ đó không phải điểm bối rối chính
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng Maya nói về sự bối rối/puzzled
> - Nhắc đến các điểm khác như USA scarce programmes và British copying American styles (context, distractors A, C)
> - Sau đó dùng signal "But the real issue is" hoặc "key problem is" để chuyển sang điểm chính
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh "stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged" - paraphrase cho failed to develop
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** USA scarcity và British copying được nhắc như background, bị削弱 bởi "But the real issue is", "key problem is"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (stagnated, didn't progress, stayed unchanged) converging vào cùng ý nghĩa - lack of development
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Trong MCQ về cause/reason for confusion, tập trung vào từ chỉ ra điểm chính/mối quan tâm thực sự ("the real issue", "key problem", "main question", "puzzling thing")
