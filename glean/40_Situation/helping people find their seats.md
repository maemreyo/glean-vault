> **Option Letter:** ==E==
> **Option Text:** ==helping people find their seats==
> **Context:** *Volunteering at community center*
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 02

> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Hành động
> **Topic Category:** Events / Volunteering
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** ==Hướng dẫn và hỗ trợ== những người tham dự sự kiện ==tìm đúng chỗ ngồi== đã được phân bổ cho họ
> - **Denotation:** Công việc ==đi cùng== khách, ==check vé hoặc ticket==, ==chỉ dẫn== đến khu vực chỗ ngồi, và ==đảm bảo== mọi người ngồi đúng chỗ
> - **Distractor:** "sitting down" (người ta ngồi chứ không phải giúp người khác ngồi), "reserving seats" (giữ chỗ chứ không phải giúp tìm chỗ), "checking tickets" (chỉ check vé chứ không chỉ dẫn)
> - **Deep Dive:** Vai trò ==usher hoặc host== tại sự kiện, liên quan đến ==điều hướng khán giả==, ==xử lý seat assignments==, và ==giải quyết conflicts== về chỗ ngồi

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** Người tình nguyện ==mặc đồng phục sự kiện==, ==cầm tờ rơi hoặc máy quét==, ==cầm vé==, ==chỉ tay hướng dẫn==, ==dẫn khách đi== theo hàng ghế
> - **Auditory:** Tiếng ==check tickets==, tiếng ==hỏi số ghế==, tiếng ==chỉ dẫn== "về bên trái", "hàng F", tiếng ==xin lỗi khi bị chặn lối==
> - **Action:** ==Nhìn vé==, ==tìm số ghế==, ==dẫn khách==, ==cúi đầu xin lỗi== khi đi ngang qua người khác
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==help people== + ==find seats==, ==guide audience== + ==to seats==, ==direct visitors== + ==to their places==
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: ==guidance of== + ==audience to seats==, ==direction of== + ==people to places==
> - `Adj + Noun`: ==seat assignment==, ==seat guidance==, ==audience seating==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I'm in charge of helping people find their seats before the event starts."
> - "The job involves helping people find their seats - we check their tickets and show them where to go."
> - "My responsibility is helping people find their seats, especially for those with mobility issues."
> - "We need volunteers to help people find their seats at the community events."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** "finding my own seat"
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì có "finding" và "seat", nhưng đây là ==action của khách chứ không phải người giúp đỡ==
> - *Actual meaning:* Khách tự tìm chỗ ngồi chứ không phải ==người hướng dẫn==
>
> **Trap 2:** "checking tickets"
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì thường đi kèm với seat finding, nhưng chỉ là một phần của process
> - *Actual meaning:* Chỉ check vé chứ không phải ==hướng dẫn đến chỗ ngồi==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Nancy handles the front-of-house duties. Her main job involves helping people find their seats. She checks their tickets and guides them to the right rows and seat numbers."
> → **Match:** ==helping people find their seats==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "What about Steve? Well, he's usually near the entrance when events begin. He spends his time helping people find their seats, making sure everyone gets to their assigned places before the show starts."
> → **Match:** ==helping people find their seats==
