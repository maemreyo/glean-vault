> [!info] 📋 Question Profile
> **Question Type:** ==multi==
>
> **Question Stem:** ==How was the gold coin found?==
>
> **Context:** *Archaeology excavation team discussing discovery methods and how artifacts are uncovered*
>
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 03

> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==Heavy rain had removed some of the soil== | mưa lớn bóc đất | washed away, rain, exposed, revealed | ⚠️ Medium |
> | B | ==the ground was dug up by wild rabbits== | thỏ đào đất | animal activity, rabbits, burrowed, disturbed | ⚠️ Low |
> | C | ==a person with a metal detector searched the area== | người dùng máy dò kim loại | detector, scanning, equipment, technology | ⚠️ High |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==A. Heavy rain had removed some of the soil==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Hình thức phát hiện (Discovery method)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Archaeology / Excavation / Nature's role==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==phát hiện nhờ thiên nhiên (natural exposure)== - mưa/bão/lũ bóc đất để lộ hiện vật
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==removed some soil = bóc đất== - quá trình tự nhiên tẩy đất lớp trên
>
> - **Distractor:** "rabbits dug up" nghe giống "disturbed ground" nhưng đó là tác động sinh vật, không phải thời tiết
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==rain removed soil → washed away, rain exposed, rain revealed, weather uncovered==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung mưa lớn rơi xuống, nước chảy xói đất, bóc dần lớp đất để lộ đồng vàng
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói: *"The rain ==washed away== the topsoil," *"Heavy rain ==exposed== it"*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động nhìn vào mảng đất bị mưa xói, thấy hiện vật
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: remove + soil, wash + away, erode + earth
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: piece + of + soil, layer + of + earth
> - `Adj + Noun`: heavy + rain, wild + rabbits, metal + detector

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "The ==heavy rain washed away== the top layer..."
>
> - "The soil was ==removed by rain==..."
>
> - "The coin was ==exposed by weather==..."
>
> - "The rain ==revealed== the artifact..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==a person with a metal detector searched the area==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Trong archaeology hiện đại, detector là phương pháp phổ biến, dễ nghĩ là cách tìm
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Audio nói đây là phát hiện ==tự nhiên, tình cờ==, không phải phương pháp tìm kiếm chủ đạo
>
> **Trap 2:** ==the ground was dug up by wild rabbits==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "dug up" là hành động xới đất, giống với việc phát hiện vật
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Dù thỏ có thể xới đất, nhưng mưa ==bóc dần lớp đất== mới là nguyên nhân chính

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Actually, we got lucky with that gold coin. It was ==exposed by heavy rain== that washed away the topsoil over several days. We just happened to spot it in the mud."
>
> → **Match:** ==Heavy rain had removed some of the soil==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The weather really helped us. The ==heavy rain removed== several layers of soil, and the coin just appeared at the surface. It was a completely natural discovery."
>
> → **Match:** ==Heavy rain had removed some of the soil==

### Card 15: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "It was actually quite a discovery. The ==heavy rain had washed away== the topsoil naturally. We didn't even need metal detectors or any equipment. Though we've seen rabbits ==digging up the ground== around here before,==that wasn't what exposed this coin==. It was purely the weather that ==removed the soil layers== and revealed the artifact."

> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** ==the ground was dug up by wild rabbits==
>
> - *Sounds like:* "rabbits digging up the ground" được nhắc trực tiếp
>
> - *Wrong because:* Audio dùng "that wasn't what exposed this coin" để loại trừ rõ ràng
>
> **2. Distractor:** ==a person with a metal detector searched the area==
>
> - *Sounds like:* "didn't need metal detectors" gợi ý về thiết bị
>
> - *Wrong because:* Audio nói "didn't even need" → loại trừ hoàn toàn việc dùng thiết bị
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==Heavy rain had removed some of the soil==
> - *Why correct:* Audio nhấn mạnh "heavy rain washed away", "purely the weather", "weather that removed soil layers"

### Card 16: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** ==Heavy rain had removed some of the soil==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "The discovery was really down to nature. ==Heavy rain had washed away== the soil over time, which ==naturally exposed== the gold coin. We've noticed that rabbits sometimes ==dig up the ground== in this area, and we do use metal detectors for other finds, but this particular coin was ==revealed purely by the weather==."

#flashcards/ielts-listening/science-tech/archaeological-discovery/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==How was the gold coin found?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. Heavy rain had removed some of the soil** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "heavy rain washed away", "naturally exposed", "purely the weather"
> 2. **B. the ground was dug up by wild rabbits** (❌) → Audio nhắc rabbits nhưng dùng "that wasn't what exposed" để loại trừ
> 3. **C. a person with a metal detector searched the area** (❌) → Audio nói "didn't even need metal detectors" → loại trừ hoàn toàn
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng người nói về phát hiện tình cờ may mắn
> - Sau đó đề cập đến các phương pháp khác (rabbits, detectors) như context nhưng dùng contrast để loại trừ
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh "purely the weather", "heavy rain washed away", "naturally exposed" - tất cả đều paraphrase cho rain removing soil
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Rabbits và Detectors được nhắc như background, bị loại trừ bởi "that wasn't", "didn't even need"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (washed away, exposed naturally, purely weather) converging vào cùng ý nghĩa
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Trong MCQ về nguyên nhân (cause), tập trung vào từ chỉ ra chủ yếu/ chính yếu ("purely", "actually", "down to", "key factor") thay vì các đề cập phụ
