> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==were difficult for audiences to obtain== | khó nhận được | hard to get, unavailable, rare, scarce | ⚠️ High |
> | B | ==were given out free of charge== | phát miễn phí | free, no cost, complimentary, gratis | ⚠️ Medium |

>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==C. were seen as a kind of contract==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Khái niệm/Ý nghĩa pháp lý (Legal concept/meaning)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Theatre / Historical Context / Business Practice==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==có tính chất hợp đồng, cam kết pháp lý== - programme được xem như thỏa thuận giữa nhà hát và khán giả
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==contract = hợp đồng== - văn bản pháp lý có ràng buộc quyền lợi
>
> - **Distractor:** "free of charge" nghe giống "accessible/available" nhưng đó là về giá tiền, không phải về tính chất
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==seen as contract → viewed as agreement, treated as binding document, considered as promise/commitment==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung người khán giả thế kỷ trước cầm programme, coi nó như ==bằng chứng cam kết== đã trả tiền
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói: *"They were actually treated like ==legal agreements==", "You could hold onto it as your proof of payment"*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động xuất trình programme để chứng minh quyền lợi
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: see + as, view + as, treat + as, consider + as
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: kind + of + contract, type + of + agreement
> - `Adj + Noun`: binding + contract, legal + document, formal + agreement

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "They were ==seen as a form of contract==..."
>
> - "Programmes were ==treated like agreements==..."
>
> - "You could ==regard them as binding documents==..."
>
> - "They served as ==evidence of payment==..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==were difficult for audiences to obtain==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Audio có thể nhắc đến "limited availability" hoặc "not easy to get"
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Dù có thể khó lấy, nhưng Finn bị ngạc nhiên chính là vì ==chúng có tính chất hợp đồng==
>
> **Trap 2:** ==were given out free of charge==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Audio nhắc đến khán giả trả tiền (paid) → dễ suy ra programme là gratis
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Programme được miễn phí VÌ đã trả tiền - nó là ==chứng minh hợp đồng== sau khi thanh toán

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "What surprised me was that early programmes weren't just handouts - they were actually ==seen as contracts==. People paid for tickets, and the programme was their ==proof of purchase== and right to be there."
>
> → **Match:** ==were seen as a kind of contract==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "It's fascinating that in early British theatre, programmes were ==treated like legal agreements==. They showed you'd paid and had ==binding effect== between the theatre and audience."
>
> → **Match:** ==were seen as a kind of contract==

### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==Finn was surprised that, in early British theatre, programmes?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. were difficult for audiences to obtain** (❌) → Audio có thể nhắc nhưng dùng "Though" để chuyển focus
> 2. **B. were given out free of charge** (❌) → Audio nói "distributed free" nhưng sau khi đã trả tiền, và "the key thing was" chuyển sang legal status
> 3. **C. were seen as a kind of contract** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "treated as contracts, legal status, binding agreements, proof of purchase"
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng Finn nói về phát hiện gây ngạc nhiên về programmes ("What surprised me was...")
> - Nhắc đến các khía cạnh khác như availability và cost (distractors A, B)
> - Sau đó dùng signal "the key thing was" hoặc "actually" để chuyển sang điểm chính
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh legal status: "treated as contracts, binding agreements, proof of purchase"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Difficulty và Free charge được nhắc như background, bị削弱 bởi "the key thing was"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (legal agreement, binding document, proof of purchase, legal status) converging vào contract concept
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Khi nghe so sánh/mô tả khái niệm, tập trung vào từ mô tả nature/essence (với "the key", "actually", "essentially") hơn là các chi tiết phụ
