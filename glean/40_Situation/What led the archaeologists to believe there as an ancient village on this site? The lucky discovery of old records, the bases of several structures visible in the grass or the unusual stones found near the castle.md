>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==B. bases of several structures visible in the grass==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Phương pháp khai quật học / Bằng chứng khảo cổ==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Archaeology / Site Investigation==
>
> **🧠 6D Framework (Logic & Lexical):**
> - **Definition:** Hình dáng **nền móng công trình nhìn thấy qua lớp đất thực vật**, do sự chênh lệch về độ dài hoặc màu sắc khi trồng trọt/cỏ, báo hiệu về cấu trúc dưới đất.
> - **Denotation Nghĩa đen:** Các vết lùm của ngôi nhà cũ, đường ranh giới, nền móng được nhìn thấy từ mặt đất do cách cây cỏ phát triển khác nhau trên nền cũ so với nền mới.
> - **Distractor:** Những từ nghe giống nhưng KHÔNG PHẢI: "old records" (tài liệu văn bản, không phải bằng chứng vật lý), "unusual stones" (hiện vật riêng lẻ, không phải bằng chứng của ngôi làng nguyên vẹn).
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing sâu hơn: ==visible in the grass → seen from ground level, crop marks, earthworks, outlines in the vegetation, patterns in the grass==
>
> - **Antonyms (Logic Flip):** Các từ/cấu trúc phủ định hoặc đối lập hoàn toàn: ==buried invisible foundations, smooth terrain, uniform grass growth, no surface traces, hidden structures, featureless field==
>
> - **Synonym Chain (Verbs):**
>   - ==reveal/expose== → Syn: ==show, denote, signify== | Ant: ==conceal, mask, hide==
>   - ==perceive/notice== → Syn: ==detect, observe, discern== | Ant: ==ignore, overlook, miss==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers (Verb-Focused):**
>
> - **Visual:** Nhìn thấy **vùng cỏ xanh thẫm nhạt xen kẽ nhau** (alternating green tones), các đường tròn, ô vuông hoặc hình dọc có hệ thống, báo hiệu về cấu trúc dưới đất như những "bóng ma" trên mặt đất (ghosts on the ground)
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe tiếng **gió thổi qua cỏ** (wind through grass), tiếng bước chân đi trên nền đất mềm, tiếng thì thầm của các nhà khảo cổ phân tích các đường vết (analyzing marks)
>
> - **Action:** Hành động cụ thể: quan sát từ trên cao (observing from above/aerial view), chụp ảnh từ máy bay không người lái (drones), dùng định vị GPS đánh dấu vị trí các vết lùm (marking patterns)
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: discover + structures, identify + foundations, notice + patterns, observe + crop marks
> - `Adj + Noun`: visible + bases, ancient + structures, old + records, unusual + stones
> - `Noun + Prep + Noun`: structures + in the grass, stones + near the castle

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "The initial clue came when..."
>
> - "We could see..."
>
> - "What really convinced us was..."
>
> - "The evidence was in the form of..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==The lucky discovery of old records==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì "records" thường là bằng chứng quan trọng trong khảo cổ học, và từ "lucky discovery" tạo ấn tượng là một câu trả lời thú vị.
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Đây là **ghi chép/tài liệu văn bản** có thể ghi về ngôi làng nhưng là bằng chứng gián tiếp, không phải bằng chứng vật lý trực tiếp tại site.
>
> **Trap 2:** ==unusual stones found near the castle==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Nghe giống vì "stones" và "found" là từ phổ biến trong khảo cổ học, và "near the castle" liên quan trực tiếp đến địa điểm đang điều tra.
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Đây là **hiện vật riêng lẻ**, có thể là tàn tích hoặc vật phẩm từ lâu đài nhưng không phải bằng chứng hệ thống chứng minh một ngôi làng nguyên vẹn.

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "At first, we came across some old documents in the local archives, which mentioned there had been a settlement here. But what really convinced us were the physical signs we could see on the ground itself. Looking from above, we could make out the bases of several structures clearly visible in the grass patterns."
>
> → **Match:** ==bases of several structures visible in the grass==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The team had noticed some strange stones scattered around the castle, but we couldn't be sure what they were. Then we looked at the aerial photographs and spotted something remarkable - the vegetation patterns revealed the outlines of several building foundations right there in the grass. That's what told us there was definitely an ancient village here."
>
> → **Match:** ==bases of several structures visible in the grass==

### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==bases of several structures visible in the grass==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We expected to find ==hidden foundations== that were ==invisible to the naked eye==, but the ==vegetation patterns== made the structures ==impossible to miss==..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK B (Bases... visible in grass)==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "expected X but Y made it Z" (X = hidden/invisible, Y = vegetation patterns, Z = impossible to miss) đã phủ định sự "bí ẩn/biến mất" (Antonyms) và khẳng định sự hiển lộ (visible). 
> - Invisible = Antonym of Visible
> - → Impossible to miss = Highly visible.
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận diện bằng chứng vật lý khi người nói phản bác giả định về sự "che giấu/không thấy được" (Antonyms) bằng các mô tả về sự tương phản trong cỏ.
