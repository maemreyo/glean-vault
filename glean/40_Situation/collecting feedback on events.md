> **Context:** *Volunteering at community center*
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 02

> [!abstract] 🎯 Target Analysis
> **Type of Info:** Hành động
> **Topic Category:** Volunteering
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Thu thập, ==tập hợp ý kiến, phản hồi== từ người tham gia về các ==sự kiện/hoạt động== đã tổ chức
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là việc ==hỏi, khảo sát, ghi nhận== ý kiến của người tham gia về ==chất lượng, trải nghiệm== của các sự kiện
> - **Distractor:** ==organizing events== (tổ chức sự kiện - hành động khác), ==attending events== (tham gia sự kiện - khác với thu thập feedback)
> - **Deep Dive:** ==gathering feedback on activities==, ==obtaining opinions about events==, ==collecting responses on programs==, ==soliciting comments on happenings==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
> - **Visual:** ==Cầm phiếu khảo sát==, ==cùng người tham gia điền form==, ==ghi chép ý kiến==, ==đứng tại bàn thông tin==
> - **Auditory:** "How did you find the event?", "What did you think of...", "Could you give us some feedback?", "What was your experience like?"
> - **Action:** ==Phát phiếu khảo sát==, ==hỏi ý kiến==, ==ghi chép==, ==tập hợp phản hồi==, ==phân tích==
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: ==collect feedback==, ==gather opinions==, ==obtain responses==, ==solicit comments==
> - `Noun + of + Noun**: ==collection of feedback==, ==gathering of opinions==
> - `Adj + Noun**: ==valuable feedback==, ==constructive comments==, ==participant responses==, ==event feedback==

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "I'm in charge of collecting feedback on events"
> - "My job involves gathering opinions about the activities we organize"
> - "I survey participants after events to see what they thought"
> - "I collect comments and suggestions from event attendees"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==organizing events==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cũng liên quan đến ==events== và làm việc tại center
> - *Actual meaning:* "Organizing" là ==tổ chức/chạy sự kiện==, còn "collecting feedback" là ==thu thập ý kiến SAU sự kiện==
>
> **Trap 2:** ==attending events==
> - *Why it's tricky:* Cũng có mặt tại ==events==
> - *Actual meaning:* "Attending" là ==tham gia như một người dự==, còn "collecting feedback" là ==làm việc thu thập ý kiến của người khác==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "After every event we organize, my role is to find out how it went from the participants' perspective. I distribute feedback forms as people are leaving and ask them to share their thoughts. Sometimes I conduct brief interviews with attendees to get more detailed responses. I collect all this information and compile it into reports for the organizers. This helps us understand what worked well and what we could improve for future events."
> → **Match:** ==collecting feedback on events==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "I'm responsible for the feedback process at our community events. I prepare questionnaires that ask participants about their experience - what they enjoyed, what could be better, and any suggestions they might have. During events, I circulate among the crowd, stopping people to chat and gather their impressions. Afterward, I organize all the responses and present the findings to the planning committee. The feedback is invaluable for improving our future activities."

### Card 4: Reverse Matching (Thực chiến)

> **Audio Script:**
> "My work begins when events conclude. I approach participants as they're leaving and ask them to share their experiences. I have feedback forms ready for them to complete, and I also conduct short interviews with willing attendees. I record what they enjoyed, what they didn't like, and any suggestions for improvement. Then I compile all this information into reports for the organizers. This feedback loop is essential for us to improve our future events."
>
> ❓ **Question:** Đoạn này ==match== với ==Option== nào?
?
> [!check] ✅ Match: ==collecting feedback on events==
> **🔍 Analysis:**
>
> - Audio nói: =="ask them to share their experiences", "have feedback forms ready", "conduct short interviews", "record what they enjoyed / didn't like / suggestions", "compile all this information"==
>
> - Tương đương với: ==collecting feedback==
>
> **🧠 Logic Chain:** Từ ==ask share experiences / feedback forms / conduct interviews / record enjoyed didn't like suggestions / compile information== + ==after events conclude / for our future events== → paraphrase thành ==collecting feedback on== + ==events==

### Card 6: Confusion Differentiation

> **Comparison:** Phân biệt =="collecting feedback on events"== với =="organizing events"==?
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Sự khác biệt cốt lõi== là gì?
?
> [!example] 🆚 Distinction

>
> **🧱 Key Barrier:** Nghe từ ==events== trong cả hai, nhưng cần phân biệt ==sau sự kiện/thu thập ý kiến (tương lai)== vs ==trong quá trình tổ chức (hiện tại/tương lai gần)==

### Card 7: Context Cloze (Điền từ)

> 🗣️ **Audio Transcript:**

>
> 🇻🇳 **Vietnamese:** Trách nhiệm của tôi là thu thập phản hồi về các sự kiện. Tôi phát phiếu khảo sát cho người tham gia và hỏi họ về trải nghiệm của họ với các hoạt động. Tôi cũng thực hiện các cuộc trò chuyện không chính thức để thu thập ý kiến và đề xuất. Tất cả thông tin này giúp chúng tôi hiểu điều gì diễn ra tốt và điều gì cần cải thiện.

### Card 9: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "Different volunteers take on different aspects of event management. Some focus on the planning and setup - arranging venues, coordinating logistics, and making sure everything is ready. Others help during events by staffing booths, guiding attendees, or running activities. My specialty comes after everything is over. I systematically collect feedback from everyone who participated. I use questionnaires, conduct interviews, and facilitate focus group discussions. I analyze the responses to identify patterns and trends. This feedback collection process is vital for improving our future events and ensuring we meet community needs effectively."

> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** =="arranging venues, coordinating logistics"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Cũng liên quan đến ==events== và làm việc tại center
>
> - *Wrong because:* Đây là ==planning/setup trước sự kiện==, không phải ==thu thập feedback SAU sự kiện==
>
> **2. Distractor:** =="staffing booths, guiding attendees, running activities"==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Cũng làm việc tại ==events==
>
> - *Wrong because:* Làm việc ==DURING sự kiện==, không phải ==thu thập phản hồi AFTER sự kiện==
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==collecting feedback on events==
> - *Why correct:* Nghe ==after everything is over / collect feedback from everyone who participated== + ==use questionnaires / conduct interviews / facilitate focus group discussions==

### Card 10: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** =="collecting feedback on events"==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "I'm the evaluation specialist for our community center's events. Once an event concludes, my work begins. I approach participants as they're leaving and invite them to share their thoughts and impressions. I've prepared structured questionnaires that cover various aspects of the event - organization, content, timing, and overall satisfaction. For those willing to go deeper, I conduct short interviews to get more detailed feedback. I also follow up with attendees a few days later to see if their perspectives have changed. All the responses I collect - whether written or verbal - are carefully analyzed and compiled into comprehensive reports for the planning team. This systematic feedback collection ensures we learn from each event and continuously improve our offerings."
