> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==have unexpected costs== | chi phí bất ngờ | unforeseen expenses, budget overruns, additional funding | ⚠️ High |

> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==A. have unexpected costs==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Kết quả/Hậu quả== của hành động phát triển
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Academic Research / Urban Planning / Environmental Studies==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** ==Unexpected costs== refers to unforeseen financial expenses that arise during development projects beyond the original budget estimates
>
> - **Denotation:** Direct meaning refers to additional monetary burdens including: hidden renovation expenses, contamination cleanup costs, or unforeseen infrastructure upgrades
>
> - **Distractor:** Similar concepts include "budget overruns" (general), "expensive" (general), "high costs" (too broad) - these lack the ==unforeseen/expected== contrast
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS context, speakers may paraphrase "unexpected costs" as: "we ran into expenses we hadn't anticipated," "there were hidden costs involved," "it proved more expensive than planned," "we didn't budget for..."

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Seeing construction crews discovering asbestos, contaminated soil, or structural issues requiring immediate attention
>
> - **Auditory:** Hearing construction project managers discussing budget revisions, contractors mentioning additional work orders, accountants calculating unexpected expenditures
>
> - **Action:** Workers stopping work to assess unexpected problems, engineers consulting blueprints, project directors calling emergency budget meetings
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + unexpected costs`: encounter, face, incur, absorb, cover
>
> - `Adjective + costs`: unforeseen, hidden, additional, unforeseen, unanticipated
>
> - `Costs + noun phrase`: costs of cleanup, renovation costs, infrastructure costs, remediation costs

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "When we started the project, we encountered costs we hadn't ==expected==."
>
> - "The redevelopment proved more ==expensive than originally anticipated== due to contamination issues."
>
> - "We had to allocate ==additional funding== for aspects we didn't foresee."
>
> - "There were ==hidden costs involved== that weren't in the original budget."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==damage the urban environment==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Students expect environmental issues from "industrial site development" and "environment" is directly mentioned
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The speakers agree about costs, not environmental damage - "damage the urban environment" is a plausible concern but NOT what they agree on
>
> **Trap 2:** ==destroy valuable historical buildings==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "destroy" and "historical" are emotionally charged words that grab attention; redevelopment often threatens heritage sites
>
> - *Actual meaning:* This is mentioned as a potential issue but the students explicitly agree on COSTS being the main concern

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Both students agreed that the main issue with redeveloping these old industrial sites is that you're likely to face costs you simply didn't anticipate. As one put it, 'there are always hidden expenses involved when you start digging around former factories.'"
>
> → **Match:** ==have unexpected costs==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "The consensus was clear: the financial implications are the real challenge. One student noted, 'we ran into unforeseen expenses that really blew the budget,' while the other confirmed this was her experience too."
>
> → **Match:** ==have unexpected costs==

### Card 7: Confusion Differentiation

> **Comparison:** Phân biệt =="have unexpected costs"== với =="be expensive"==?
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Sự khác biệt cốt lõi== là gì?
?
> [!example] 🆚 Distinction
> - **have unexpected costs:** Tập trung vào sự KHÔNG ĐỢI TRƯỚC - the key is SURPRISE element, not just high price
>
> - **be expensive:** Tập trung vào giá cả cao - chỉ nói về chi phí mà KHÔNG nhấn mạnh sự bất ngờ
>
> **🧱 Key Barrier:** "Expensive" is general; "unexpected" requires hearing contrast words like "didn't anticipate," "wasn't in the budget," "we didn't foresee"

>
> - **Spelling Trap:** Watch for double 's' in "unexpected" and correct spelling of "costs" (not "coasts")
>
> **🔗 Connects to:** ==have unexpected costs==

### Card 15: Full Distractor Analysis

> **Full Script (including distractors):**
> "The students discussed various concerns about the industrial site redevelopment. One initially worried about ==damage to the urban environment==, mentioning potential pollution. Another raised concerns about ==losing valuable historical buildings== on the site. However, they both concluded that the most significant issue was having ==costs that were not expected==. As one put it, 'the budget overruns really caught us off guard.'"
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Phân tích từng distractor== và ==tại sao sai==?
?
> [!bug] 🕵️ Distractor Breakdown
> **1. Distractor:** ==damage the urban environment==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Environmental concern is discussed at length with pollution mentions
>
> - *Wrong because:* This is mentioned as an INITIAL concern, but the speakers shift away from it and reach agreement on COSTS as the main issue
>
> **2. Distractor:** ==lose/destroy valuable historical buildings==
>
> - *Sounds like:* Historical buildings are mentioned as a potential issue
>
> - *Wrong because:* Again, discussed but not the AGREED outcome - "both concluded" points to costs, not buildings
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==have unexpected costs==
> - *Why correct:* "Both concluded" + "costs that were not expected" + "budget overruns really caught us off guard" = clear agreement

### Card 16: Script-to-Option Mapping

> **Option Text:** ==have unexpected costs==
>
> **Audio Transcript:**
> "When examining the redevelopment of disused industrial sites, the students reached a consensus. They acknowledged that while environmental damage and historical loss are concerns, the most pressing issue is financial. One student explained that they faced ==expenses they hadn't anticipated==, while the other confirmed that ==unforeseen budget implications== were indeed the key challenge. They both agreed that these ==unplanned for costs== represented the biggest obstacle."
>
> ❓ **Question:** ==Highlight== và giải thích tất cả các ==paraphrases== từ Audio → Option?
?
> [!example] 🎯 Paraphrase Mapping
> - ==expenses they hadn't anticipated== → unexpected costs (hadn't anticipated = not expected = unexpected)
>
> - ==unforeseen budget implications== → unexpected costs (unforeseen = unexpected, budget implications = costs)
>
> - ==unplanned for costs== → unexpected costs (unplanned = not expected)
>
> - ==reached a consensus== → agreed (context for question)
>
> **🧠 Overall Logic:** Multiple paraphrases for the same concept reinforce the answer; "consensus" confirms the agreement aspect

### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==The students agree that developing disused industrial sites may...?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. have unexpected costs** (✅) → Consensus reached on financial unpredictability
>
> 2. **B. damage the urban environment** (❌) → Discussed as concern but not the agreed outcome
>
> 3. **C. destroy valuable historical buildings** (❌) → Mentioned but dismissed as main issue
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Audio starts by presenting multiple concerns about industrial site redevelopment (environmental impact, historical preservation)
> - Then uses agreement signals like "both agreed," "the consensus was," "they both concluded" to shift to the shared viewpoint
> - Confirms the answer with multiple paraphrases for "unexpected costs": "expenses not anticipated," "unforeseen budget implications," "costs we hadn't budgeted for"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Environmental and historical concerns are mentioned as topics of discussion but distinguished from what the students AGREE upon using contrast markers
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Agreement markers ("both agreed," "consensus") + cost vocabulary + negative/contrast words ("hadn't," "unforeseen," "unexpected") = correct answer
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When questions ask what speakers "agree on," listen specifically for consensus markers and the point where speakers converge, not all topics mentioned during discussion
