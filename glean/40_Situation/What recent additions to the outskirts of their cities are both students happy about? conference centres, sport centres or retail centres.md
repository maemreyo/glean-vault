> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Cơ sở hạ tầng/Thiết bị == (Infrastructure/Facility)
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Academic Research / Urban Development / Social Leisure==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** ==Retail centres== refer to large commercial buildings or complexes that contain multiple shops, stores, and businesses, typically located in suburban or outlying areas of cities
>
> - **Denotation:** Direct meaning includes: shopping malls, commercial complexes, retail facilities, shopping areas with multiple stores
>
> - **Distractor:** Similar concepts include "markets," "shops," "stores" - these are individual or smaller units, not ==large commercial centres==
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS context, speakers may paraphrase "retail centres" as: "shopping centres," "malls," "commercial complexes," "retail facilities," "shopping areas," "commercial developments"

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Seeing large modern buildings with many shops, parking lots, people carrying shopping bags, bright storefronts, retail signage
>
> - **Auditory:** Hearing students discuss "shopping centres," "malls," "retail facilities," "commercial areas," "shopping facilities"
>
> - **Action:** People shopping, walking through malls, visiting multiple stores, carrying bags to cars, entering large retail complexes
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Adjective + retail centres`: new, modern, large, shopping, commercial
>
> - `Verb + retail centres`: build, open, develop, construct, establish
>
> - `Retail centres + location`: in the outskirts, in suburbs, on the edge, on the periphery

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "They're both pleased about the new ==shopping centres==."
>
> - "The recent ==malls== in their cities."
>
> - "New ==retail facilities== have been built."
>
> - "Commercial complexes ==on the outskirts==."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==conference centres==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "Conference" and "centres" are vocabulary words often heard together in academic contexts, suggesting professional facilities
>
> - *Actual meaning:* The development is RETAIL/COMMERCIAL, not business/conference related
>
> **Trap 2:** ==sport centres==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Students often express satisfaction with recreational facilities, and "sport centres" are positive developments
>
> - *Actual meaning:* While sports facilities are mentioned, the focus is on SHOPPING/RETAIL additions

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Both students expressed that they're happy about the new shopping centres that have been built in the outskirts of their cities. One noted that these retail facilities are very convenient for residents."
>
> → **Match:** ==retail centres==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "They discussed recent developments in their cities. Both agreed that the new retail centres on the edge of town have been a positive addition. As one student explained, 'Having these shopping malls nearby has really improved things for everyone.'"
>
> → **Match:** ==retail centres==

### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==What recent additions to the outskirts of their cities are both students happy about?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. conference centres** (❌) → Mentioned as useful but not what both are happy about
>
> 2. **B. sport centres** (❌) → Mentioned as constructed but not the focus
>
> 3. **C. retail centres** (✅) → What both students are particularly happy about
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Audio begins with students discussing multiple types of new developments (conference centres, sport centres)
> - Then uses agreement/satisfaction signals like "both particularly happy about," "what really excites us both," "what pleases them both" to identify the SHARED POSITIVE focus
> - Confirms the answer with multiple retail-related paraphrases: "shopping malls," "commercial complexes," "shopping facilities," "retail centers"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Conference and sport centres are mentioned as developments that exist ("have been built," "constructed") but are distinguished from what students "both particularly happy about" using focus signals
> - **Confirmation Logic:** "Both happy about" + agreement signals + shopping/retail vocabulary = correct answer
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When questions ask what speakers are "both happy about," listen specifically for consensus/satisfaction markers and the item that receives the most positive/shared emphasis
