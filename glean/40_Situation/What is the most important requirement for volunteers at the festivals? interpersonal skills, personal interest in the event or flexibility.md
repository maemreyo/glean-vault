> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Người chịu trách nhiệm/Kỹ năng==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Volunteering== at ==Festivals==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**

>
> - **Denotation:** Skills needed for ==communication and cooperation== in a social setting, referring to qualities like friendliness, patience, and ability to work in teams

> - **Distractor:** "Personal interest" (enthusiasm) might be mentioned but qualified as "nice to have but not essential"; "flexibility" might be mentioned as secondary quality
>
> - **Deep Dive:** In IELTS Listening, "most important requirement" questions often involve ==comparative language== such as "above all", "essential", "what really matters", "the key thing is", or "must have". Listen for ranking phrases that distinguish the primary requirement from secondary ones

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Volunteers ==interacting with festival visitors==, helping people, smiling and communicating with crowds
>
> - **Auditory:** Coordinator saying "What's really essential is..." or "The most important thing is..."
>
> - **Action:** Volunteers working together in teams, greeting attendees, solving problems together
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: have + skills, need + ability, develop + communication, work + with + people
>
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: interaction + with + public, dealing + with + people
>
> - `Adj + Noun`: good + communication, social + skills, personal + interest

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "What really matters is how you get on with people"
>
> - "The ability to communicate well is absolutely essential"
>
> - "Above all, you need to have good people skills"
>
> - "The most important thing is your interpersonal ability"

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** =="personal interest in the event" mentioned positively==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Speaker might say "it helps if you're interested" or "enthusiasm is great" making it sound important
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Interest is described as desirable or beneficial but NOT as the "most important" or "essential" requirement
>
> **Trap 2:** =="flexibility" as useful quality==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* Speaker may discuss how volunteers need to adapt, making flexibility seem critical
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Flexibility is mentioned as a secondary quality or "nice to have", not the primary requirement

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "Of course it's wonderful if you have a personal interest in the festival, and being flexible certainly helps. But the most important requirement, what you absolutely must have, are excellent interpersonal skills - you're dealing with the public all day."
>
> → **Match:** ==A. interpersonal skills==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "Flexibility is definitely useful, as is enthusiasm for the event. However, what we really need above all else are people with strong interpersonal skills - the ability to communicate and work effectively with others."
>
> → **Match:** ==A. interpersonal skills==
