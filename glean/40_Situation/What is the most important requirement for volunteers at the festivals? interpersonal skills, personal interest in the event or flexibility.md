#flashcards/ielts-listening/cam-20-test-2/social-leisure/festivals/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> What is the most important requirement for volunteers at the festivals?
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. interpersonal skills** (✅) → Described with strongest priority language: "most important", "absolute priority", "can't do without"
> 2. **B. personal interest in the event** (❌) → Mentioned as "nice to have" but not essential - contrasted with priority language for correct answer
> 3. **C. flexibility** (❌) → Referenced as "some people think" - attribution to others' opinions, not speaker's main requirement
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Starts by acknowledging distractors (flexibility, personal interest) with attribution language like "Some volunteers think..." or "Others believe..."
> - Uses contrast markers "However," "But," "From our perspective" to shift focus
> - Emphasizes correct answer with superlatives: "most important," "absolute priority," "what we absolutely need"
> - Reinforces with necessity language: "simply can't do without," "essential"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Distractors are prefaced with attribution to others' opinions, then contrasted - classic IELTS MCQ pattern
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Correct answer gets multiple priority markers (most important, absolute priority, essential) while distractors get secondary/conditional language (nice to have, helpful, some think)
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When listening to MCQs, pay attention to attribution language ("some think") vs. direct speaker assertion ("we prioritize") and superlative/necessity markers

### Card 20: Logic Flip & Antonym Reflex

> **Option:** ==interpersonal skills==
>
> ❓ **Reflex:** Nếu audio dùng ==Antonym== sau đây, bạn sẽ chọn gì?
>
> *"We weren't looking for those who ==prefer working alone== or ==avoid team interaction==; the most critical requirement was ==strong interpersonal skills== and being ==good with people==..."*
?
> [!warning] 🔄 Logic Flip Status
> **👉 Verdict:** ==STILL PICK interpersonal skills==
>
> **🧠 Reason:** Cấu trúc "weren't looking for X (Antonym); instead, the critical requirement was Y (Synonym)" đã phủ định sự làm việc độc lập (Antonym) và khẳng định kỹ năng giao tiếp. 
> - Prefer working alone = Antonym of Interpersonal skills (teamwork focus)
> - → Good with people = Interpersonal skills.
>
> **🎯 Skill:** Nhận diện đúng yêu cầu khi người nói bác bỏ các đặc điểm "cô lập/thiếu giao tiếp" (Antonyms) để mô tả tính chất xã hội (interpersonal skills) của công việc.
