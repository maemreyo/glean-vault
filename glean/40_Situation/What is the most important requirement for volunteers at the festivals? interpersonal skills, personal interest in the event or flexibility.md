#flashcards/ielts-listening/cam-20-test-2/social-leisure/festivals/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> What is the most important requirement for volunteers at the festivals?
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. interpersonal skills** (✅) → Described with strongest priority language: "most important", "absolute priority", "can't do without"
> 2. **B. personal interest in the event** (❌) → Mentioned as "nice to have" but not essential - contrasted with priority language for correct answer
> 3. **C. flexibility** (❌) → Referenced as "some people think" - attribution to others' opinions, not speaker's main requirement
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Starts by acknowledging distractors (flexibility, personal interest) with attribution language like "Some volunteers think..." or "Others believe..."
> - Uses contrast markers "However," "But," "From our perspective" to shift focus
> - Emphasizes correct answer with superlatives: "most important," "absolute priority," "what we absolutely need"
> - Reinforces with necessity language: "simply can't do without," "essential"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Distractors are prefaced with attribution to others' opinions, then contrasted - classic IELTS MCQ pattern
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Correct answer gets multiple priority markers (most important, absolute priority, essential) while distractors get secondary/conditional language (nice to have, helpful, some think)
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** When listening to MCQs, pay attention to attribution language ("some think") vs. direct speaker assertion ("we prioritize") and superlative/necessity markers
