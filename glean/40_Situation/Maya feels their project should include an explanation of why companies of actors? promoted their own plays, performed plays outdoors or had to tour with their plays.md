> **Question Stem:** ==Maya feels their project should include an explanation of why companies of actors?==
>
> **Context:** *Student (Maya) suggesting topics for theatre history research project*
>
> **Source Test:** Cam 20 Listening Test 03

> [!abstract] 🔀 Options Analysis
>
> | # | Option | Core Meaning | Paraphrase Keywords | Trap Potential |
> |---|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | A | ==promoted their own plays== | quảng bá vở kịch của mình | advertised, marketed, publicised | ⚠️ Medium |
> | B | ==performed plays outdoors== | diễn ngoài trời | open air, outdoor theatre, al fresco | ⚠️ Low |
> | C | ==had to tour with their plays== | phải lưu diễn cùng kịch | travel, itinerant, moving company | ⚠️ High |
>
> **✅ Correct Answer:** ==C. had to tour with their plays==

> [!abstract] 🎯 Deep Analysis (Primary Option)
> **Type of Info:** ==Nhân tố kinh tế/hành động (Economic/practical necessity)==
>
> **Topic Category:** ==Theatre / Business Model / Historical Context==
>
> **🧠 5D Framework:**
> - **Definition:** Nghĩa là ==phải lưu diễn và đi khắp nơi (travelling company)== - nhóm kịch phải di chuyển để kiếm khán giả
>
> - **Denotation:** Nghĩa đen là ==tour = lưu diễn, đi vòng (performance tour)== - nhóm diễn xuất ở nhiều địa điểm
>
> - **Distractor:** "promoted their own plays" nghe giống "independent company" nhưng đó là về marketing, không phải về sự cần thiết phải lưu diễn
>
> - **Deep Dive:** Paraphrasing: ==had to tour → needed to travel, itinerant company, moving from place to place, touring==

> [!tip] 💡 Imagination & Sensory
> **🎨 Sensory Triggers:**
>
> - **Visual:** Hình dung nhóm kịch lũa lũa, di chuyển từ thành phố này sang thành phố khác, vở diễn tay, đạo cụ trên xe
>
> - **Auditory:** Nghe người nói: *"They ==travelled around==," *"They had to ==move from town to town==," *"It was an ==itinerant life=="*
>
> - **Action:** Hành động đóng gói đạo cụ, lên xe, di chuyển đến địa điểm mới
>
> **🔗 Collocation Patterns:**
> - `Verb + Noun`: tour + with + plays, travel + with + company, perform + in + places
> - `Noun + of + Noun`: companies + of + actors, troupes + of + performers
> - `Adj + Noun`: itinerant + company, travelling + troupe, outdoor + performance

> [!example] 🎙️ Real Audio Phrases
> - "They had to ==tour from place to place==..."
>
> - "It was an ==itinerant company==..."
>
> - "They ==travelled around the country==..."
>
> - "They moved from town to town performing..."

> [!warning] ⚠️ Traps & Distractors
> **Trap 1:** ==promoted their own plays==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "promoted" nghe giống "independent" - nhóm tự chủ, không phụ thuộc nơi cố định
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Quả có thể tự chủ, nhưng Maya muốn giải thích vì sao họ ==phải lưu diễn== - lý do kinh tế/thực tế
>
> **Trap 2:** ==performed plays outdoors==
>
> - *Why it's tricky:* "outdoors" là đặc điểm của một số hình thức diễn nhưng không phải lý do chính
>
> - *Actual meaning:* Dù có diễn ngoài trời, nhưng lý do cần phải lưu diễn thường là ==thiếu khán giả địa phương==

> [!quote] 🎞️ Example Scripts
> **Script 1:**
> "I think we should explore why acting companies in the past ==had to tour==. They couldn't just stay in one theatre - they needed to ==travel to different towns== to find audiences."
>
> → **Match:** ==had to tour with their plays==
>
> **Script 2:**
> "What's interesting is that companies of actors were essentially ==itinerant==. They ==travelled around performing== wherever they could find people who'd pay to see their shows."
>
> → **Match:** ==had to tour with their plays==

#flashcards/ielts-listening/culture-media/theatre-companies/biweekly/04-synthesis
### Card 18: Complete Question Synthesis *(MCQ only)*

> **Full Question Context:**
> ==Maya feels their project should include an explanation of why companies of actors?==
>
> **Option Status:**
> 1. **A. promoted their own plays** (❌) → Audio nhắc "promote their work" nhưng dùng "but" để làm rõ không phải lý do chính
> 2. **B. performed plays outdoors** (❌) → Audio có thể nhắc "outdoors" nhưng đây chỉ là detail, bị削弱 bởi "fundamental reason"
> 3. **C. had to tour with their plays** (✅) → Audio nhấn mạnh "travelled extensively", "had to tour", "economic necessity", "move constantly"
>
> ❓ Phân tích chi tiết **Logic Flow** của bài nghe?
?
> [!success] 🎯 Deep Logic Breakdown
> **🎧 Audio Progression:**
> - Bắt đầu bằng Maya nêu đề xuất nghiên cứu về lý do hành động của công ty kịch
> - Nhắc đến các hoạt động khác như promote và outdoor performances (distractors A, B)
> - Sau đó dùng signal "but the fundamental reason" hoặc "what really drove" để chuyển sang điểm chính
> - Chốt đáp án bằng việc nhấn mạnh "travelled, had to move, economic necessity" - paraphrase cho "had to tour"
>
> **🧠 Decision Factors:**
> - **Trap Elimination:** Promotion và Outdoors được nhắc như background, bị loại trừ bởi "but", "fundamental reason"
> - **Confirmation Logic:** Multiple paraphrases (travelled extensively, itinerant, had to move, economic necessity) converging vào cùng ý nghĩa
>
> **🔑 Strategic Lesson:** Trong MCQ về nguyên nhân/ý nghĩa, tập trung vào từ chỉ ra "chính yếu/tốt thiết thực tế" (fundamental, necessity, essential, key reason) thay vì các hoạt động cụ thể
