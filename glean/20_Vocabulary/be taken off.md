### Group 3: Differentiation (Cards 6, 11)

#flashcards/cam-20-listening-test-02/03-differentiation
### Card 6: Nuance Barrier (Comparison)

🆚 **Nuance:** Why use **be taken off** instead of **[[sold out]]**?
?
> **be taken off:** Dùng khi nói về việc ngừng bán/loại bỏ (active removal by seller/manager) - VN: bị rút, bị loại bỏ chủ động
> **[[sold out]]:** Dùng khi nói về hết hàng do khách mua (natural depletion) - VN: hết vì bán hết
> 🧱 **The Barrier:** "Taken off" là active decision (người bán quyết định rút hàng), "sold out" là natural outcome (khách tự nhiên mua hết hết). Khi đồ bị "taken off", có thể còn hàng trong kho nhưng không được bán. Khi "sold out", hàng tự nhiên hết do khách mua.

🕵️ **Fix the Error:** "The shop took off those products because they were old."
?
> ✅ **Correction:** "The shop took those products off because they were old." OR "Those products were taken off because they were old."
> 🧠 **Why:** "Be taken off" là phrasal verb, "take...off" phải đứng liền nhau. Không thể nói "took off that products" (rời tách).

### Card 13: Synonym Context Quiz

🧩 **Quiz:** In this context, which synonym of **be taken off** is correct?
**Context:** You're working at a retail store. The manager announces that a popular electronic item will no longer be sold. They're removing all remaining units from displays.
**Sentence to complete:** "The manager says this product will _____ the market by tomorrow."
**Options:**
- A) [[sell out]]
- B) [[discontinue]]
- C) [[retire]]
?
> ✅ **Answer:** [[be taken off]] (specific context - phrasal expression)
> 🧠 **Why:** Trong context này (manager actively removing units from display), "be taken off" là chính xác nhất vì thể hiện active removal (manager quyết định rút hàng). "Sell out" chỉ dùng khi hết do khách mua (không phải active removal). "Discontinue" và "retire" cũng chấp nhận nhưng "taken off" thể hiện immediate removal action.

### Card 14: Antonym Context Quiz

🔃 **Quiz:** In this context, which antonym of items being **taken off** is correct?
**Context:** You're shopping for winter coats. You ask a salesperson about a specific brand. They show you the inventory status on their computer system.
**Sentence to complete:** "Good news! That brand is still _____ and available in your size."
**Options:**
- A) [[taken off]]
- B) [[out of stock]]
- C) [[on clearance]]
?
> ✅ **Answer:** [[in stock]] (antonym of taken off - still available)
> 🧠 **Why:** Trong context mua sắm (shopping context), "in stock" là đối lập (opposite) của "taken off". "Out of stock" là giống "taken off" (không còn). "On clearance" có thể có nghĩa giảm giá (discounted), không phải antonym của availability. "In stock" thể hiện còn hàng để mua (available for purchase).
