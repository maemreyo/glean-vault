>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** sự trao đổi chất
> - **Contextual:** tổng hợp các phản ứng hóa học trong cơ thể để duy trì sự sống
>
> **Nuances:**
> - Includes catabolism (breaking down) and anabolism (building up)
> - Determines energy needs and weight management
> - Varies between individuals

> [!tip] 💡 Word Vibe & Story
> **Personality:** Active, Transformative, Essential
> **Memory Hook:** Think "meta" (beyond/after) + "bolism" (throw) = your body throwing food beyond recognition to extract energy
> **📖 Etymology Story:** Ancient Greeks observed the mysterious transformation of food into life energy. They coined "metabolism" to capture this continuous process of change that defines living organisms - from the molecular dance within cells to the energy that powers our every thought

> [!failure] Common Mistakes
> **1. Mistake Type**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** "My metabolism is fast because I eat healthy"
> - ✅ **Correction:** "My metabolism is fast, so I can eat more without gaining weight"
> - **Why:** Metabolism determines how you process food, not the other way around

> [!quote]- Contex Source
> **Quote:** "Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms."

## 🧠 Spaced Repetition Flashcards

### Card 1: Meaning & Mental Model (Multi-line)

What does **metabolism** (*/məˈtæb.ə.lɪz.əm/*) mean?
?
> 📖 **Meaning:** All chemical processes in living organisms that maintain life, including energy conversion
> 🇻🇳 **Vietnamese:** Tất cả các quá trình hóa học trong sinh vật duy trì sự sống, bao gồm chuyển đổi năng lượng
> 🗣️ **IPA:** */məˈtæb.ə.lɪz.əm/*
> 🧠 **Mental Model:** Body's "factory system" - receives food as raw materials, converts to energy (catabolism) và builds cells (anabolism)

---

### Card 2: Production (Reverse)

**Definition:** "The sum of all chemical reactions in an organism that maintain life and produce energy"
**Vietnamese:** Tổng hợp tất cả các phản ứng hóa học trong sinh vật duy trì sự sống và tạo ra năng lượng
→ **Target Word?**
?
**metabolism** (*/məˈtæb.ə.lɪz.əm/*)

---

### Card 3: Usage & Analysis (Multi-line)

Use **metabolism** in a sentence.
?
> 📝 **Sentence:** Athletes generally have a faster metabolism due to their higher muscle mass and training intensity.
> 🇻🇳 **Translation:** Vận động viên thường có sự trao đổi chất nhanh hơn do khối lượng cơ bắp và cường độ tập luyện cao hơn.
> 🔍 **Analysis:** Metabolism hoàn hảo khi explain biological process of energy conversion in relation to physical fitness (VN/EN mix)

---

### Card 4: Collocations by Logic (Multi-line)

List 3 common collocations for **metabolism**.
?
> 🔗 **Collocations:**
> 1. **Descriptive adjectives:** slow/fast/efficient metabolism (<VN note: mô tả tốc độ>)
> 2. **Action verbs:** boost/increase/slow down metabolism (<VN note: hành động tác động>)
> 3. **Related concepts:** metabolic rate/metabolic disorder (<VN note: các khái niệm liên quan>)

---

### Card 5: Word Upgrade (The "Writer's Rewrite")

🚀 **Upgrade:** Make this boring sentence specific using **metabolism**:
"My body burns food slowly."
?
> 🖋️ **Advanced:** "My slow metabolism makes it difficult to maintain a healthy weight despite regular exercise."
> 💡 **Why it works:** Metabolism tạo hình ảnh khoa học, chính xác hơn về biological process thay vì "burns food" đơn giản (VN)

---

### Card 6: Nuance Barrier (Comparison)

🆚 **Nuance:** Why use **metabolism** instead of **[[digestion]]**?
?
> **metabolism:** VN - Toàn bộ chemical reactions trong cells để create energy/build tissues, happens 24/7
> **digestion:** VN - Chỉ process breaking down food trong digestive system, happens when eating
> 🧱 **The Barrier:** Metabolism = cellular energy production vs digestion = food breakdown (whole body vs digestive tract)

---

### Card 7: Scenario Reaction

🎭 **Scenario:** You're a nutritionist explaining why some people lose weight easily. You're knowledgeable and helpful. Say it!
?
> 🎬 **Line:** "Your metabolism plays a crucial role in determining how quickly you burn calories."
> 👨‍🎨 **Director's Note:** Metabolism thể hiện chuyên môn khoa học trong nutrition counseling (VN)

---

### Card 8: Etymology Story

🌱 **Origins:** Link the root `metabole` to the meaning of **metabolism**.
?
> 📜 **Story:** Greek 'metabole' = "change". Your metabolism is the constant change happening inside you - food becoming energy, cells being rebuilt, life maintained through transformation (VN/EN mix)

---

### Card 9: Word Family & Roots

Analyze the root/family of **metabolism**.
?

### Card 11: Mistake Hunter (Error Correction)

🕵️ **Fix the Error:** Common mistake with **metabolism**?
?
> ❌ **Mistake:** "I need to speed up my metabolism by eating more"
> ✅ **Correction:** "I need to speed up my metabolism through exercise and strength training"
> 🧠 **Why:** Exercise increases muscle mass which naturally boosts metabolism, not eating more. Eating affects metabolism indirectly

---

### Card 12: Antonym Flip

↔️ **Flip:** What is the opposite of active **metabolism**?
?
> **Antonyms:**
> - [[metabolic slowdown]] (reduced chemical activity)
> - [[hibernation]] (extremely reduced metabolism)
> 🧱 **Contrast:** Active metabolism = normal energy processes vs metabolic slowdown = reduced energy conservation (difference is rate of energy use)
