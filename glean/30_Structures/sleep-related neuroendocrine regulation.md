> - **Component 1:** [Compound Adjective] (sleep-related) - specifying the connection/relationship
> - **Component 2:** [Compound Noun] (neuroendocrine) - describing the system type
> - **Component 3:** [Noun] (regulation) - the main process being described
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. "Sleep-related" is hyphenated as it acts as a single adjective
> 2. "Neuroendocrine" combines neuro- + endocrine without hyphen
> 3. The structure follows a modifier-modifier-head pattern
> 4. Scientific compound following specific field conventions

> **Core Meaning:**
> - **Literal:** The control and coordination of hormone and nervous system functions related to sleep
> - **Figurative:** N/A (purely scientific term)
>
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To describe the complex biological processes governing sleep-related physiological functions
> - **Nuance:** Highly technical, academic/medical context
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** điều hòa nội tiết thần kinh liên quan đến giấc ngủ

> [!note] Relations & Connections
> **Synonyms / Similar Structures:**
> - [[circadian rhythm control]] /sɜːrˈkeɪdiən ˈrɪðəm kənˈtroʊl/ : biological 24-hour cycle regulation
> - [[sleep-wake cycle modulation]] /sliːp weɪk ˈsaɪkl ˌmɒdʒuˈleɪʃən/ : regulation of sleep patterns
> - [[hormonal sleep regulation]] /hɔːrˈmoʊnl sliːp ˌreɡjuˈleɪʃən/ : hormone-based sleep control

> **Antonyms / Contrasting Structures:**
> - [[sleep disruption]] /sliːp dɪsˈrʌpʃən/ : interference with normal sleep patterns
> - [[endocrine imbalance]] /ˈendəʊkrɪn ɪmˈbæləns/ : hormonal dysregulation
> - [[circadian misalignment]] /sɜːˈkeɪdiən ˌmɪsəˈlaɪnmənt/ : disruption of biological rhythms

> [!failure] Common Mistakes
>
> **1. Hyphenation Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** Sleep related neuroendocrine regulation affects mood. (missing hyphen)
> - ✅ **Correction:** Sleep-related neuroendocrine regulation affects mood.
> - **Why:** "Sleep-related" acts as a single adjective modifying "neuroendocrine regulation" and requires a hyphen.
>
> **2. Word Order Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** Neuroendocrine sleep-related regulation is complex. (incorrect modifier order)
> - ✅ **Correction:** Sleep-related neuroendocrine regulation is complex.
> - **Why:** "Sleep-related" modifies the entire phrase "neuroendocrine regulation," so it must come first.

> [!tip] Learning Strategies
> - **Visual Association:** Picture brain (neuro) + hormone glands (endocrine) + moon (sleep) + control panel (regulation)
> - **Memory Hook:** "Sleep-related" = about sleep; "neuroendocrine" = nerves + hormones; "regulation" = control
> - **Common Collocations:** sleep disorders, endocrine system, hormonal balance, circadian rhythms
> - **Related Structures:** [[sleep hygiene]] vs [[sleep-related neuroendocrine regulation]] - behavioral practices vs biological processes
