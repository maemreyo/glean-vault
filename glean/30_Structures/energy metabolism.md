# energy metabolism

> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Compound Noun Pattern
>
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> [Noun] + [Noun]
> energy + metabolism
> ```
>
> **Components:**
> - **Component 1:** [Noun] (energy) - specifying the type/subject
> - **Component 2:** [Noun] (metabolism) - the main process
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. Noun-noun compound where first noun acts as adjective
> 2. "Energy" specifies the metabolic process type
> 3. No hyphen needed (standard compound formation)
> 4. Scientific/technical terminology in biology and physiology

> [!abstract] Meaning & Usage
> **Core Meaning:**
> - **Literal:** The biochemical processes by which cells convert food into energy
> - **Figurative:** The pace at which someone consumes and uses energy
>
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To describe the body's energy production and utilization processes
> - **Nuance:** Scientific/medical context, technical terminology
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** chuyển hóa năng lượng
> - **Contextual:**
> -  trao đổi chất năng lượng, sự trao đổi chất tạo năng lượng

> [!note] Relations & Connections
> **Synonyms / Similar Structures:**
> - [[cellular respiration]] /ˈseljələr ˌrespəˈreɪʃn/ : process of converting glucose to ATP
> - [[metabolic rate]] /məˈtæbəlɪk reɪt/ : speed of energy expenditure
> - [[bioenergetics]] /ˌbaɪoʊˌenərˈdʒetɪks/ : study of energy flow in living systems

> **Antonyms / Contrasting Structures:**
> - [[energy conservation]] /ˈenərdʒi ˌkɑːnsərˈveɪʃn/ : saving rather than using energy
> - [[metabolic slowdown]] /məˈtæbəlɪk ˈsloʊˌdaʊn/ : reduced energy processing
> - [[energy storage]] /ˈenərdʒi ˈstɔːrɪdʒ/ : keeping energy for later use

> [!success] Usage Examples
>
> **1. Formal Context**
> - **Sentence:** The study examined how thyroid hormones influence energy metabolism in mammalian cells.
> - **Translation:** Nghiên cứu đã xem xét hormone tuyến giáp ảnh hưởng đến chuyển hóa năng lượng trong tế bào động vật có vú như thế nào.
> - **Analysis:** Scientific research paper discussing hormonal effects on cellular processes.
>
> **2. Informal Context**
> - **Sentence:** My doctor said my energy metabolism is slow, so I need to exercise more.
> - **Translation:** Bác sĩ nói chuyển hóa năng lượng của tôi chậm, vì vậy tôi cần tập thể dục nhiều hơn.
> - **Analysis:** Patient-doctor conversation about metabolic health.
>
> **3. Business/Academic Context**
> - **Sentence:** Our research focuses on compounds that boost energy metabolism for weight management applications.
> - **Translation:** Nghiên cứu của chúng tôi tập trung vào các hợp chất tăng cường chuyển hóa năng lượng cho ứng dụng quản lý cân nặng.
> - **Analysis:** Pharmaceutical or nutraceutical research proposal.

> [!failure] Common Mistakes
>
> **1. Plural Formation Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** The body's energy metabolisms work together. (incorrect plural)
> - ✅ **Correction:** The body's energy metabolism works as a system.
> - **Why:** "Energy metabolism" is a singular concept/process, not something that comes in multiple forms.
>
> **2. Article Usage Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** Exercise improves an energy metabolism. (incorrect article)
> - ✅ **Correction:** Exercise improves energy metabolism.
> - **Why:** "Energy metabolism" is an uncountable concept and doesn't take "a/an" when used generically.

> [!tip] Learning Strategies
> - **Visual Association:** Picture microscopic power plants (mitochondria) inside cells
> - **Memory Hook:** "Energy" + "metabolism" = energy + change/processing = how body processes energy
> - **Common Collocations:** boost metabolism, slow metabolism, metabolic rate, basal metabolism
> - **Related Structures:** [[energy expenditure]] vs [[energy metabolism]] - expenditure is output, metabolism is processing system

> [!quote]- Meta Information
> | Property | Value |
> | :--- | :--- |
> | **Complexity** | advanced |
> | **CEFR Level** | C1 |
> | **Frequency** | common in science/health |
> | **Register** | scientific/medical |
> | **Grammar Focus** | compound nouns, uncountable nouns |

## 🧠 Spaced Repetition Flashcards

### Card 1: Pattern Recognition

🧩 **Pattern Analysis:** What is the structure pattern for **energy metabolism**?
?
> 🏗️ **Structure:** [Noun] + [Noun] (compound)

---

### Card 2: Functional Meaning

🤔 **Meaning:** What does **energy metabolism** express?
?
> 📖 **Function:** The biochemical processes by which organisms convert food into usable energy for cellular functions

---

### Card 3: Contextual Usage

❓ **Usage:** When should you use **energy metabolism**?
?
> 📝 **Context:** In biological discussions, medical contexts, nutrition science, or when explaining how the body processes food for energy

---

### Card 4: Example

✍️ **Production:** Create a sentence with **energy metabolism** about exercise
?
> 🧪 **Example:** Regular aerobic exercise enhances energy metabolism, improving the body's efficiency at burning calories.

---

### Card 5: Error Correction

🕵️ **Spot the Error:** What's wrong with: "Fast energy metabolisms help people stay thin"?
?
> 🛠️ **Correction:** Remove plural: "Fast energy metabolism helps people stay thin" (metabolism is singular concept)

---

### Card 6: Comparison

🆚 **Comparison:** How is **energy metabolism** different from [[digestion]]?
?
> ⚖️ **Difference:** Digestion breaks down food into absorbable nutrients, while energy metabolism converts those nutrients into cellular energy (ATP).

---
