## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake ❌ | Correction ✅ | Explanation |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| "I'm keen on to learn Japanese" | "I'm keen on learning Japanese" | Use gerund (-ing), not infinitive after preposition |
| "She is keen in music" | "She is keen on music" | Fixed preposition - always use "on" after "keen" |
| "They keen on playing football" | "They are keen on playing football" | Need the verb "be" before adjective "keen" |
| "He is very keen on it very much" | "He is very keen on it" OR "He likes it very much" | Don't double intensifiers |

### Error Patterns
1. **Pattern Error: Wrong verb form after "on"**
   - **Common mistake:** Using infinitive instead of gerund
   - **Why it happens:** Direct translation from languages where infinitives are used
   - **How to avoid:** Remember: Preposition + Gerund (on + learning)

2. **Usage Error: Wrong preposition**
   - **Common mistake:** Using "in", "about", or "for" instead of "on"
   - **Why it happens:** Interference from other adjective-preposition pairs
   - **How to avoid:** "Keen" is always followed by "on" - it's a fixed collocation
