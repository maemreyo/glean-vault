to divide and multiply
> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Infinitive Phrase with Paired Verbs (Process Description)
>
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> [Infinitive Marker] + [Verb] + [Conjunction] + [Verb]
> ```
>
> **Components:**
> - **Component 1:** Infinitive Marker "to" - indicates purpose or action
> - **Component 2:** Verb "divide" - to separate into parts
> - **Component 3:** Conjunction "and" - connects two related actions
> - **Component 4:** Verb "multiply" - to increase in number
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. Infinitive form used for both verbs (base form without to)
> 2. Parallel structure requires same verb form for both actions
> 3. "And" connects sequential or related processes
> 4. Often used to describe complementary or cyclical processes

> [!abstract] Meaning & Usage
> **Core Meaning:**
> - **Literal:** The mathematical operations of division and multiplication
> - **Figurative:** To separate and then increase, to break down and expand
>
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To describe two complementary processes or actions
> - **Nuance:** Scientific/mathematical register, suggests growth through division
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
