10 minute exposures
> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Compound Noun Phrase / Technical Term
>
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> [Number: 10] + [Time Unit: minute] + [Plural Noun: exposures]
> ```
>
> **Components:**
> - **Component 1:** `10 minute` - hyphenated compound adjective (when before noun)
> - **Component 2:** `exposures` - plural noun indicating instances of being exposed
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. Hyphenate when used as adjective before noun: "10-minute exposure"
> 2. No hyphen when used as noun phrase: "exposures of 10 minutes"
> 3. Plural "exposures" indicates multiple instances

> [!abstract] Meaning & Usage
> **Core Meaning:**
> - **Literal:** Multiple instances of being subjected to something for 10 minutes each
> - **Figurative:** Brief but repeated encounters with situations or conditions
>
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To quantify duration and frequency of exposure
> - **Nuance:** Technical, precise, clinical or scientific
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** những lần phơi nhiễm 10 phút
> - **Contextual:** các phiên tiếp xúc kéo dài 10 phút

> [!note] Relations & Connections
> **Synonyms / Similar Structures:**
> - [[brief exposures]] /briːf ɪkˈspəʊʒəz/ : short duration contacts
> - [[repeated exposure]] /rɪˈpiːtɪd ɪkˈspəʊʒə/ : multiple contacts
> - [[time-limited exposure]] /taɪm ˈlɪmɪtɪd ɪkˈspəʊʒə/ : duration-limited contact

> **Antonyms / Contrasting Structures:**
> - [[continuous exposure]] /kənˈtɪnjuəs ɪkˈspəʊʒə/ : uninterrupted contact
> - [[extended exposure]] /ɪkˈstɛndɪd ɪkˈspəʊʒə/ : long duration contact

> [!success] Usage Examples
>
> **1. Formal Context**
> - **Sentence:** The study participants received 10 minute exposures to the experimental conditions.
> - **Translation:** Những người tham gia nghiên cứu nhận được những lần phơi nhiễm 10 phút với điều kiện thực nghiệm.
> - **Analysis:** Scientific methodology description
>
> **2. Informal Context**
> - **Sentence:** My therapy involves 10 minute exposures to my fear triggers.
> - **Translation:** Liệu pháp của tôi bao gồm những lần tiếp xúc 10 phút với các tác nhân gây sợ hãi.

> [!failure] Common Mistakes
>
> **1. Hyphenation Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** 10 minute exposures (as adjective)
> - ✅ **Correction:** 10-minute exposures
> - **Why:** Hyphen needed when number-unit modifies noun
>
> **2. Agreement Error**
> - ❌ **Mistake:** 10 minutes exposure
> - ✅ **Correction:** 10 minute exposure / 10 minutes of exposure
> - **Why:** Unit doesn't pluralize when part of compound adjective

> [!tip] Learning Strategies
> - **Visual Association:** Timer showing 10:00 repeatedly
> - **Memory Hook:** Like taking multiple 10-minute photos of something
> - **Common Collocations:** to radiation, to sunlight, to chemicals, to therapy
> - **Related Structures:** [[15-minute break]] vs [[10 minute exposures]]

> [!quote]- Meta Information
