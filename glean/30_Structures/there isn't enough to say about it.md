> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Pattern (Expression of limited content/discussion value)
>
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> There + [isn't/aren't/wasn't/weren't] + enough + [to say/to discuss/to talk about] + about + [it/that/this/topic]
> ```
>
> **Components:**
> - **Introductory phrase:** There (existential construction)
> - **Negative verb:** isn't/aren't/wasn't/weren't + not (optional)

>
> **Formation Rules:**
