embryo development
> [!info] Structural Analysis
> **Structure Type:** Compound Noun (Scientific Terminology)
>
> **Formula / Pattern:**
> ```text
> [Noun] + [Noun]
> ```
>
> **Components:**
> - **Component 1:** Noun "embryo" - specifies the biological stage/organism
> - **Component 2:** Noun "development" - indicates the process of growth/change
>
> **Formation Rules:**
> 1. First noun acts as adjective (attributive noun) specifying type
> 2. No preposition or possessive needed between compound nouns
> 3. Second noun is the head noun (main concept)
> 4. Stress typically falls on first noun in speech: EM-bryo development

> [!abstract] Meaning & Usage
> **Core Meaning:**
> - **Literal:** The process by which an embryo grows and develops
> - **Figurative:** The early stages of any developmental process
>
> **Functional Meaning:**
> - **Purpose:** To describe the biological process of embryonic growth
> - **Nuance:** Scientific register, precise biological terminology
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** sự phát triển phôi
> - **Contextual:** quá trình phát triển của phôi thai, sự phát triển phôi thai

> [!note] Relations & Connections
> **Synonyms / Similar Structures:**
> - [[embryogenesis]] : More technical single term for same process
> - [[fetal development]] : Later stage of prenatal development
> - [[cell differentiation]] : Key process within embryo development
>
> **Antonyms / Contrasting Structures:**
> - [[cell degeneration]] : Breakdown rather than development
> - [[embryonic arrest]] : Development stops rather than continues

> [!success] Usage Examples

**1. Formal Context**
- **Sentence:** The research team observed critical stages of embryo development under laboratory conditions.
- **Translation:** Nhóm nghiên cứu đã quan sát các giai đoạn quan trọng của sự phát triển phôi thai trong điều kiện phòng thí nghiệm.
- **Analysis:** Scientific academic writing using standard biological terminology

> [!failure] Common Mistakes

**1. Pluralization Error**
- ❌ **Mistake:** embryos development
- ✅ **Correction:** embryo development
- **Why:** First noun in compound remains singular even when referring to multiple embryos

**2. Preposition Error**
- ❌ **Mistake:** development of embryo
- ✅ **Correction:** embryo development
- **Why:** Compound noun structure is more concise and standard in scientific terminology

**3. Word Order Error**
- ❌ **Mistake:** development embryo
- ✅ **Correction:** embryo development
- **Why:** Type/specifier comes before the main concept in English compound nouns

> [!tip] Learning Strategies
- **Visual Association:** Picture a timeline showing cell division and growth
- **Memory Hook:** "Embryo" tells you WHAT is developing
- **Common Collocations:** stages, phases, normal, abnormal, early, late, monitor, study
- **Related Structures:** [[brain development]] vs [[embryo development]]
