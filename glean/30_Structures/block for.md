### Variations

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake ❌ | Correction ✅ | Explanation |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| "I'm blocking for you" | "I'm blocking time for you" | Need to specify WHAT is being blocked |
| "Block for two hours" | "Block [something] for two hours" | Missing object - must state what's blocked |
| "The road blocks for the parade" | "The road is blocked for the parade" | Passive voice more natural here |
| "They blocked for going home" | "They blocked time for going home" | Need explicit object after "block" |

### Error Patterns
1. **Pattern Error: Missing Object**
   - **Common mistake**: Omitting the object after "block"
   - **Why it happens**: Direct translation from languages where object is implied
   - **How to avoid**: Always ask yourself: "What is being blocked?"

2. **Usage Error: Wrong Preposition**
   - **Common mistake**: Using "block from" instead of "block for"
   - **Why it happens**: Confusion with other "block" phrasal verbs
   - **How to avoid**: Remember "for" = duration/purpose, "from" = prevention
