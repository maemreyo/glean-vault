## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake ❌ | Correction ✅ | Explanation |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| "I shut down it" | "I shut it down" | With pronouns, MUST separate: verb + pronoun + particle |
| "The computer was shutted down" | "The computer was shut down" | "Shut" is irregular - past tense is "shut", not "shutted" |
| "They shutted down the factory" | "They shut down the factory" | Same rule - "shut" is the same for present and past tense |
| "Please to shut down your system" | "Please shut down your system" | No "to" after "please" when giving commands |

### Error Patterns
1. **Pattern Error: Pronoun Separation**
   - **Common mistake:** "shut down it", "shut down them"
   - **Why it happens:** Learners treat phrasal verbs as single units with all objects
   - **How to avoid:** Remember: PRONOUNS separate the verb and particle

2. **Usage Error: Tense Formation**
   - **Common mistake:** "shutted down", "has shutted down"
   - **Why it happens:** Overgeneralization of regular -ed past tense rule
   - **How to avoid:** "Shut" is irregular - present and past are identical
