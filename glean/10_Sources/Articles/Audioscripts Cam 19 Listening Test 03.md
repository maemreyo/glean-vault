### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 1

LEON: Hi Shannon – how are you settling into your new flat?

SHANNON: Really well, thanks.

LEON: You [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] you’re going shopping.

SHANNON: Yes, I am. My [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousins]] are coming to stay for a couple of days, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I have to cook for them.

LEON: Well, there are plenty of places to buy food in Kite Place – it’s the area by the harbour. ***Q1***

SHANNON: Oh. OK, I’ll find that on the map. Thanks.

LEON: What sort of food do you need to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]]?

SHANNON: Well, neither of them eats meat [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they both [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] fish.

LEON: Well, there’s a really good fish market there.

SHANNON: Oh great – where is it [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]]?

LEON: It’s at [[20_Vocabulary/the far end|the far end]] of Kite Place, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] you have to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|go over]] the bridge [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then it’s on the right. ***Q2***

SHANNON: OK – is it open all day?

LEON: It doesn’t close until four, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’d [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] going earlier than that – it does [[20_Vocabulary/run out of|run out of]] some things.

SHANNON: Oh, I don’t want that to happen.

LEON: As long as you [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] there by 3.30. you should be fine. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] 11 now, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] plenty of time. ***Q3***

SHANNON: Right.

LEON: Do you need to buy vegetables [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]?

SHANNON: I do, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I want to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] all the plastic [[20_Vocabulary/packaging|packaging]] in the supermarket!

LEON: Well, there’s a really nice organic shop there. Now what’s it called … it’s the name of a flower. I know, it’s ‘ Rose ’. ***Q4***

SHANNON: That’s a nice name.

LEON: Yeah – it sells vegetables [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] quite a lot of other stuff.

SHANNON: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] where’s that?

LEON: Well, as you [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|reach]] the market, you’ll see a big grey building on your left – I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to be a [[20_Vocabulary/Warehouse|warehouse]]. Anyway, now it’s a restaurant upstairs, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] the ground floor has two shops either side of the [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|entrance]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it’s the one on the left.

SHANNON: That’s easy enough.

LEON: You can’t miss it – there’s [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] a big sign on the pavement [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] you can [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] for that. ***Q5***

SHANNON: Fine! I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] I need anything else, I’ll have to go to the supermarket.

LEON: Yeah – you should be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] everything you need, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there’s a minibus that goes to the supermarket [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you need it. It’s purple [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the number is 289. ***Q6***

SHANNON: Thanks, that’s great.

LEON: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] what do you need to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] at the fish market? The [[20_Vocabulary/salmon|salmon]] is always very good [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the shellfish.

SHANNON: I’m [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] make a curry, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I need [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] 12 prawns for that.

LEON: They’ll have plenty of those.

SHANNON: OK.

LEON: Have you ever tried samphire? ***Q7***

SHANNON: No – what’s that?

LEON: It’s a [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]] of [[20_Vocabulary/seaweed|seaweed]]. I just ask for a handful [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] you fry it in butter. It’s delicious!

SHANNON: Oh, I might try that- how do you [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spell]] it?

LEON: It’s S-A-M-P-H-l-R-E.

SHANNON: Great – it’s always good to try something different.

LEON: Yeah.

SHANNON: I’ll see what beans they have in the organic shop [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] something for dessert there.

LEON: How [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a mango?

SHANNON: I’m not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] – they’re not always ripe. I’d prefer a melon – it’s bigger [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. ***Q8***

LEON: Good idea. The owner [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] sells a lot of spices there that you can put in a curry, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] things [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] coconut. ***Q9***

SHANNON: Oh, that’s very [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]]. I’ll have a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]].

LEON: No problem.

SHANNON: I know bread doesn’t really go with curry [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I always [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] to have some in case.

LEON: As I said – all the bread is home-made [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there’s lots of [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] the brown bread myself.

SHANNON: Mm, sounds good.

LEON: They sell other things there [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

SHANNON: [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Like]] cakes? I love chocolate cake.

LEON: Well – not that, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they have a whole [[20_Vocabulary/variety|range]] of tarts [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the best are the strawberry ones. ***Q10***

SHANNON: Perfect – hopefully I won t [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] have to go to the supermarket!

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: The children’s book festival is coming up [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|again]] soon [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] here to tell us all [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it is the festival’s organiser, Jenny Morgan. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] tell us what we can expect this year, Jenny.

[[20_Vocabulary/Bookshelves|Bookshelves]]

JENNY: Well, as [[20_Vocabulary/average|usual]] we’ve got five days of action-packed exciting events for children, with writers coming from all [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] the country getting [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]].

Just to give you an idea of what’s on [[20_Vocabulary/propose|offer]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshops]], first of all, there’s a very special event called Superheroes. This is a [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] for deaf children to [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] their reading experiences with author Madeleine Gordon, who is herself hearing [[20_Vocabulary/impair|impaired]]. ***Q11***

‘Just do it’ is a practical [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]] led by the [[20_Vocabulary/well known|well-known]] [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|illustrator]] [[20_Vocabulary/mark|Mark]] Keane. He’ll take participants on a magical [[20_Vocabulary/boat trip|journey]] to faraway lands with an [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opportunity]] for aspiring actors to do some role play. ***Q12***

‘[[20_Vocabulary/depend on|Count on]] me’ is an inspiring [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] entertaining [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the issues of friendship for 13–14-year-olds. ***Q13***. It [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] at some of the friendships described in [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]] books [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] asks participants to compare these with [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]] experiences.

‘Speak up’ is [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] a series of [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshops]] on the subject of [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|mental health]]. This is a [[20_Vocabulary/an art form|creative]] writing [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]] encouraging children to describe situations where young people [[20_Vocabulary/go through|experience]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]]. A recent [[20_Vocabulary/Have a look around|survey]] [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|revealed]] that children can be [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|lonely]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] when they’re at home with their families. ***Q14***

‘Jump for joy’, as many of you [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] know, is the [[20_Vocabulary/cardiovascular disease|heart]]-warming, best-selling story by Nina Karan [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a young girl’s trip to visit her [[20_Vocabulary/extended family|relatives]] in India. It recently received the [[20_Vocabulary/medal|gold medal]] at the Waterford Awards. Nina [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] children to celebrate the word ‘joy’ by writing a poem. ***Q15***

‘Sticks [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] stones’ is the beautifully [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|illustrated]] [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|picture]] book for young readers [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a community who organise an African-Caribbean festival to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] children learn [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] their Jamaican roots. ***Q16***. This [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be a musical event where children [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] have the [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] to play [[20_Vocabulary/steel drum|steel drums]]. This is bound to be very [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] please book [[30_Structures/as soon as|as soon as]] [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]].

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: Thanks Jenny. That all sounds really interesting. I’m just wondering [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you have a [[20_Vocabulary/favourite|favourite]] book you could [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] for our readers?

JENNY: It’s hard to choose, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] *[[20_Vocabulary/existence|Alive]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Kicking* is [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] mentioning. You won’t have heard of the writer as it’s her first book – which is really [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressive]]. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basically]] [[20_Vocabulary/the teenage diary of a boy|the teenage diary of a boy]] from Somalia who comes to live in the UK. It deals with the serious issue of [[20_Vocabulary/immigration|immigration]] ***Q17/18*** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] all the challenges the boy has to [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|face]] at school [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] with [[20_Vocabulary/the language barrier|the language barrier]], etc. Usually, books [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] this are quite sad, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this one actually made me cry with laughter. ***Q17/18***. On each page, there are simple [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/hilarious|hilarious]] black [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] white [[20_Vocabulary/cling|stick]] drawings of the boy with his friends [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] teachers. At the end of each [[20_Vocabulary/diary entry|diary entry]], there are new English words the boy learns each day, which may [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] [[20_Vocabulary/come along|develop]] some children’s vocabulary.

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] my kids [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoy]] that. What [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] any advice for parents on how to [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|encourage]] their children to read more?

JENNY: Well, this is something I [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] asked [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a lot. There are [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] many [[20_Vocabulary/distraction|distractions]] for kids these days that it can be hard to find time for reading. One thing I’d say is to make time to sit down with your child [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] books with them. A lot of parents give up reading aloud to their children [[30_Structures/as soon as|as soon as]] they learn to read [[20_Vocabulary/independently|independently]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this is a mistake. It’s good to read more advanced books to them as it helps to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|develop]] their vocabulary. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you don’t have time for this, then let them listen to audio books. Often, they’ll want to read books they’ve listened to [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|for themselves]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it’s a good idea to make a [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|mental]] note of the [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]] of books your child is reading – often they just read the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] [[20_Vocabulary/genre|genre]] all the time, which can [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] a bit boring. You can introduce new authors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/genre|genres]] to them. Librarians should be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] you with this. ***Q19/20***

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: Well Jenny, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] that’s really [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]]….

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

CLARE: Hi Jake. How are you getting on with the practical teaching?

JAKE: It’s harder than I expected, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’ve got some great classes. How [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] you?

CLARE: Not [[20_Vocabulary/brilliant|brilliant]]. I’m really [[20_Vocabulary/struggling|struggling with]] my Year 12 science class.

JAKE: Are they hard to [[20_Vocabulary/dominates political|control]]?

CLARE: Well, I don’t have discipline problems as such. It’s just that they don’t [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seem to]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] that science has anything to do with their lives. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/depression|depressing]]. They listen to what I say, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I gave them a [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|test]] [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]] week [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the results weren’t [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] bad, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there’s no real [[20_Vocabulary/interaction|engagement]]. ***Q21***

JAKE: Right.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] as [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] my teaching practice, I have to design [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] for them to do. I was wondering [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] something on the children’s diets… you know, asking them to record what they eat [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] linking it to their state of [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]].

JAKE: Mmm. Let’s [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] your [[20_Vocabulary/methodology|methodology]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involve]] the children recording what they eat. OK, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] you’d [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] need to have access to the children’s [[20_Vocabulary/clinical form|medical records]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I don’t [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] people [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be happy [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that; [[20_Vocabulary/confidentiality|confidentiality]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be an issue. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you could [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] the right data, the conclusions might be [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suspect|suspect]] it’s just not [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be easy. ***Q22***

CLARE: Right.

JAKE: Have you thought [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] doing [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] using animals?

CLARE: Wouldn’t that be [[20_Vocabulary/upset|upsetting]] for the children?

JAKE: Well, the animals don’t have to be [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harmed]] in any way. It could just be [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] where they’re given a [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|certain]] [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the effects are observed.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Would]] I have to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] permission to use animals?

JAKE: Yes, you’d have to submit an outline of the experiment [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] fill in a [[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it’s quite straightforward.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] out that, say, a [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particular]] [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]] affects the [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] of animals, the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] thing wouldn’t necessarily be true for people, [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] it? ***Q23***

JAKE: No that’s true, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] the findings for any experiment are [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be limited. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|inevitable]].

CLARE: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] what animals could I use to investigate the effects of [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]]? Mice?

JAKE: Yes. You’d need [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|experimental]] mice – ones that have been specially bred for [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|experiments]]. OK, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] what [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] your experiment be investigating [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]]?

CLARE: Well, something to do with [[20_Vocabulary/nutrition|nutrition]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] we could [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at food supplements… things [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] iron [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] protein, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] their [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]].

JAKE: Mmm. That might be rather broad. [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|Maybe]] just [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the effects of one [[20_Vocabulary/supplement|supplement]], [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] sugar, on the [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] of the mice?

CLARE: In fact, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] the focus could be on whether mice can [[20_Vocabulary/dominates political|control]] [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]] [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]]. ***Q24***

JAKE: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], what happens when they have access to more sugar, that they don’t really need?

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|Exactly]]. Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?

JAKE: Great. Then later on, you could do a [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|follow]]-up experiment adding another variable. [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Like]], you could give some of the mice the [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] to be more active, running on a wheel or something, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the others just sit [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] don’t do much. ***Q25***

CLARE: Or I could [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|repeat]] the experiment [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] the [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]] of food I provided... or use mice with a different genetic structure. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] your idea [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be more interesting, I might [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] that some more.

———————————————

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] can I talk through a [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] procedure for the experiment where mice are given a sugar [[20_Vocabulary/supplement|supplement]]?

JAKE: [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|Sure]]. I did a similar experiment in college actually.

CLARE: Great. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] how many mice [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] I need?

JAKE: I’d say [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] 12. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] all young ones, not [[20_Vocabulary/a mixture|a mixture]] of [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] young. ***Q26***

CLARE: OK. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] I’d need two groups of equal sizes, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] six in each group. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] how [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] I tell them apart? I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] I could put some sort of [[20_Vocabulary/badge|tag]] on one group… or just [[20_Vocabulary/mark|mark]] them in some way?

JAKE: You could use [[20_Vocabulary/food colouring|food colouring]], that wouldn’t [[20_Vocabulary/harm|hurt]] them. ***Q27***

CLARE: Perfect. Then each group [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] go into [[20_Vocabulary/a separate cage|a separate cage]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] one group, let’s call them group A, [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be the [[20_Vocabulary/dominates political|control]] group. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] they’d just have [[20_Vocabulary/average|ordinary]] mouse food. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] you can buy that?

JAKE: Yes, it comes in [[20_Vocabulary/dry pellets|dry pellets]].

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] the other group [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] as the first group, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they’d [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] have the [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] sugar.

JAKE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Would]] you just give them straight sugar?

CLARE: I might be better to give them something [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/cereal|cereal]] with it. ***Q28***

JAKE: Hmm. Then you’d need to weigh the mice, I should [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] a week. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] you’d need an electronic balance.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] we can’t [[20_Vocabulary/hold|hold]] them on the balance, or it’d [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] the reading.

Shop for bestsellers

JAKE: [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|Exactly]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] you need something called [[20_Vocabulary/a weighing chamber|a weighing chamber]] to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|stop]] the mice from running [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]]. It sounds [[20_Vocabulary/complicate|complicated]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] actually you can just use a plastic box with holes in the top. ***Q29***

CLARE: OK. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] we’ve measured the weight [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|gain]] of each mouse we can work out the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] for each group, [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] the [[20_Vocabulary/average|standard]] deviation. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] then see where we go from there. That sounds cool, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] the students [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoy]] it. ***Q30***

JAKE: Yes. One thing…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

In today’s lecture, I’m [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be talking [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]].

[[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|Microplastics]] are [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|tiny]] [[20_Vocabulary/piece|pieces]] of plastic smaller than five millimetres in size. Recently there’s been a greater [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|awareness]] that there are large quantities of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] – big [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]] – in the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]]. The amount of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] in the oceans has received [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|widespread]] [[20_Vocabulary/attention|attention]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] far less is known [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the effects of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] in freshwater [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] in [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]].

[[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|Microplastics]] can enter the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]] via a number of different sources. Threads [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] microfibres [[20_Vocabulary/detach|detach]] from [[20_Vocabulary/synthetic clothing|synthetic clothing]] ***Q31*** every time they’re put in a washing machine, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these find their way into the water system. Other sources [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] big [[20_Vocabulary/piece|pieces]] of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] that are already in the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these [[20_Vocabulary/degrade|break down]] into [[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] [[20_Vocabulary/particles|particles]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] a period of time. On a larger scale, factory [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] is another route, as are tyres which [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] down as cars, [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|lorries]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] on travel along road surfaces.

We already understand some of the [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impacts]] of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] from studies [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involving]] fish [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other animals. There is [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] that [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]] creatures in a [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]] of ways, such as by damaging their mouths, ***Q32***, or by [[20_Vocabulary/impair|impairing]] their [[20_Vocabulary/capable|ability]] to feed, for example when [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] lodged in their [[20_Vocabulary/digestive system|digestive system]].

[[20_Vocabulary/surprise|Surprisingly]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]], it is likely that humans [[20_Vocabulary/consumption|consume]] [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]], as these have been detected in [[20_Vocabulary/a wide range of|a wide range of]] food [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] drink [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]], including bottled water, [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] in water that comes direct from the tap. What’s more, salt [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] many kinds of seafood have [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] been [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] to [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|contain]] [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]]. ***Q33***

[[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], it’s [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to underline that there is not yet [[20_Vocabulary/conclusion|conclusive]] [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|proof]] that [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|cause]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]] [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] to people. In many countries, including here in the UK, there is [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|legislation]] which prevents manufacturers from adding plastic [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microbeads]] to shower gels, facial cleansers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] toothpaste. ***Q34***

It is very difficult to [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|accurately]] [[20_Vocabulary/guess|estimate]] the total amount of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] [[20_Vocabulary/particles|particles]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] as they can be hard to detect, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we do know they are carried in the air [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/deposit|deposited]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] by rain. What’s more, many of the fertilisers [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] by both farmers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] gardeners [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|contain]] [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]]. ***Q35***

A team from the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge has carried out a [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|study]] of the effects of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] on [[20_Vocabulary/the digestive tracts of earthworms|the digestive tracts of earthworms]]. These worms, which live in topsoil, are an [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] [[20_Vocabulary/segment|component]] of our agricultural system. By feeding on [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], they [[20_Vocabulary/a mixture|mix]] [[20_Vocabulary/nutrition|nutrients]] into it, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|thereby]] making it more fertile. ***Q36***

The researchers [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] out to discover whether the introduction of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastics]] into the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/the subsequent ingestion|the subsequent ingestion]] of these by [[20_Vocabulary/earthworm|earthworms]] – [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] [[20_Vocabulary/attribute|quality]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|ultimately]] [[20_Vocabulary/inhibit|inhibit]] plant growth. ***Q37***. The [[20_Vocabulary/brief|short]] answer was, yes, it did. After placing three different types of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] [[20_Vocabulary/particles|particles]] into the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], they planted [[20_Vocabulary/perennial rye grass|perennial rye grass]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/particles|particles]] of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]], which included [[20_Vocabulary/biodegradable|biodegradable]] PLA [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/conventional high-density polyethylene|conventional high-density polyethylene]], or [[20_Vocabulary/conventional high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], were then ingested by the [[20_Vocabulary/earthworm|earthworms]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/impact|result]] was that the worms [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] weight rapidly. ***Q38***. What’s more, a lower percentage than [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/perennial rye grass|rye grass]] seeds [[20_Vocabulary/germinate|germinated]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the researchers concluded that this was a direct [[20_Vocabulary/impact|result]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/earthworm|earthworms]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] unable to fulfil their [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] role in making [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] more fertile. The team [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] discovered that there was an increase in the amount of [[20_Vocabulary/acid|acid]] [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], ***Q39***, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] this was [[20_Vocabulary/attribute|attributed]] [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] to the [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] [[20_Vocabulary/particles|particles]] from conventional [[20_Vocabulary/conventional high-density polyethylene|HDPE]] plastic.

The conclusions of the [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|study]] make for very interesting reading – I’ve included the reference in the notes to give you at the end of this session. To summarise, the authors [[20_Vocabulary/propose|proposed]] the idea that we need to regard [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] as we [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] regard any other process in [[20_Vocabulary/messy nature|nature]]. This means we should [[20_Vocabulary/admit|accept]] the [[20_Vocabulary/implication|implications]] of [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|dependent on]] [[20_Vocabulary/decay|decaying]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] dead matter constantly [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] passed through the bodies of [[20_Vocabulary/earthworm|earthworms]]. That is, when [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] becomes [[20_Vocabulary/impoverish|impoverished]] by [[20_Vocabulary/the presence of microplastics|the presence of microplastics]], not [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] ecosystems [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] the whole of [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|society]] are negatively [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impacted]]. ***Q40***
