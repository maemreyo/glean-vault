**WOMAN** It’s [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] good to see you, Tom. Since I had to give up work, I [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] I’m losing touch with my friends [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] colleagues.

**MAN** We [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] miss you in the office. We were all [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/regret|sorry]] you had to leave. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] you must be relieved to have more time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] after your mother. How is she?

**WOMAN** Well she is very cheerful, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] she needs a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]].

**MAN** Have you tried to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] any [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] from the [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]]?

**WOMAN** No, I didn’t know I could.

**MAN** Yes, they [[20_Vocabulary/propose|offer]] [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] kinds of practical [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]]. They realise that carers sometimes need time for all the other responsibilities they have, apart from the person they’re [[20_Vocabulary/caring|caring]] for, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] that they sometimes need a break.

**WOMAN** [[20_Vocabulary/Unquestionably|Absolutely]]. OK, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] tell me more. How do I go [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] getting this [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]]?

**MAN** Well, you’d have to have an [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]] of your mother’s needs. That means someone [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] round [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] talk to you [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the situation [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] what you need. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], for a start, they’d want to know the amount of time you spend looking after your mother every day.

**WOMAN** OK.

**MAN** Then they’ll [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] ask you what sorts of tasks you do for your mother during the day. Things [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] she needs [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] with getting dressed, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]].

**WOMAN** Right. I [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] her with that. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And also]] I [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] her [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] into the shower in the morning.

**MAN** Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|that sort of thing]].

**WOMAN** Yes, that’s becoming a bit of a problem. She [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to be very good at it, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|not anymore]].

*Before you hear the [[20_Vocabulary/relax|rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|conversation]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions five to ten. you Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 5 to 10.*

**WOMAN** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], recently I’ve noticed she’s started to have quite bad problems with her memory. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] I wasn’t there, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] she’d forget to eat, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] often she doesn’t [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|seem]] quite [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] what day it is.

MAN Yes, tell them [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] are there any physical difficulties you have [[20_Vocabulary/caring|caring]] for her? Lifting her, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]]?

**WOMAN** Yes, she’s quite heavy [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I’m afraid of hurting my back. I’d be in real [[20_Vocabulary/bother|trouble]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] that happened.

**MAN** They can give you advice [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] how to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] the possibility of your mum having a [[20_Vocabulary/sink|fall]].

**WOMAN** Great. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] they’ve done this [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]], [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] I’m eligible, what happens next?

**MAN** Well, they might [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] you [[20_Vocabulary/financial|financially]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] they might [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] you with transport costs, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you have to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] a taxi to take your mother for an appointment, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]].

**WOMAN** I usually [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|drive]] her myself, [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], could I [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claim]] the petrol?

**MAN** You could. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] you can [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claim]] for the insurance [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

**WOMAN** Oh, right.

**MAN** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you need [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] with the housework, they can [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arrange]] for someone to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|come along]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] or twice a week. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] one other thing. I hope you don’t mind me saying this, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] you

[[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] after yourself [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] it [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seems to]] me you [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] quite a bit of [[20_Vocabulary/stress|stress]]

**WOMAN** I am yes

**MAN** Well tell the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] because they may be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to give you some advice on how to minimise it

**WOMAN** [[20_Vocabulary/actually|Really]]? [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|Though]], [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]], I [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] much better having talked to you. I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] in touch with the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] [[20_Vocabulary/immediately|straight away]]. Now, [[20_Vocabulary/will|shall]] we go for coffee or something?

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

Good morning everyone. I’m Steve Wainwright from Elmley Town [[20_Vocabulary/council|Council]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I organise the town’s volunteer [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|scheme]]. I’m [[20_Vocabulary/delight|delighted]] you’re all [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested in]] joining the [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|scheme]]. Our volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] to [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] [[20_Vocabulary/a sense of community|a sense of community]] among the many people who live in our historic town of Elmley [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] make [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|residents]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] visitors [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] welcome at [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] events. First, I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]] just a few of the activities that volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/carry out|carry out]]. One is to walk [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the town centre streets wearing our volunteer T-shirt. Tourists often ask how to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] to a [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particular]] shop, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they might [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] be [[20_Vocabulary/grateful|grateful]] for recommendations [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] what to visit. The town [[20_Vocabulary/hold|holds]] a large number of [[20_Vocabulary/concert|concerts]] each year [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] the volunteers’ role is to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] everyone in the [[20_Vocabulary/spectator|audience]] to the right place as [[20_Vocabulary/smoothly|smoothly]] as [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]]. You’d be [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprised]] how many people buy tickets, then don’t [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] them, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/head for|head for]] the wrong [[20_Vocabulary/segment|section]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/hall|hall]]. Volunteers may [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]] with community groups, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] sports clubs or gardeners’ [[20_Vocabulary/association|associations]]. Here, the volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] how groups can [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|each other]]. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For instance]], a writing group might want to travel to another town to hear a talk by a well- known author, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] may not know that another club has a [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|coach]] they could travel in. The town produces a monthly magazine, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] anyone who lives in the town can send in articles. It’s free to [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|residents]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] is paid for by [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] businesses. That’s the [[20_Vocabulary/responsible for|responsibility]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]]’s [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|advertising]] [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|department]] we [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|depend on]] volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] to find out what people [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] of events they’ve attended [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] any suggestions they have for the future the volunteers then send a [[20_Vocabulary/brief|summary]] to the editors there are a number of clubs for [[20_Vocabulary/retire|retired]] people [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] every year the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arranges]] [[20_Vocabulary/meal|lunch]] for all the members the volunteers welcome the guests [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] when everyone’s sitting down [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relaxing]] after the [[20_Vocabulary/meal|meal]], some volunteers put on a [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]]. Usually [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] half an hour of songs [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/brief|short]] plays, the club members [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] welcome the [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] to chat to the volunteers at these events. The town [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] has a website, of course, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] volunteers are asked to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] by making [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|residents]] know [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it It updated every day with information [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] future activities [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we want as many people as [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] to use it.

*Before you hear the [[20_Vocabulary/relax|rest]] of the talk, you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 17 to 20. Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 17 to 20. OK, now you know some of the things our volunteers do, I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/go on|go on]] to some practical matters.*

As you [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] know, the town [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arranges]] three major festivals every year, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they all [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|depend on]] a large number of volunteers. The book festival [[20_Vocabulary/lasts three days|lasts three days]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] uses [[20_Vocabulary/several venues|several venues]] which all need volunteers. More are needed for the music festival because that [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|lasts]] a whole week, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] more [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] is required for the science festival, [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] two days long. It [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involves]] quite a lot of venues, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]]. It’s a good idea to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] at the festival you’re most [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested in]], because you can [[20_Vocabulary/come along|attend]] most of the events for free. We [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] to use volunteers who are [[20_Vocabulary/flexibility|flexible]], [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]], because some festival events are [[20_Vocabulary/hold|held]] outdoors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the weather may [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] the size of the [[20_Vocabulary/spectator|audience]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] whether the event can [[20_Vocabulary/take place|take place]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] there can be changes at [[20_Vocabulary/brief|short]] notice What [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] is [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] on well with other people [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] to deal with someone who’s behaving badly, as [[20_Vocabulary/occasion|occasionally]] happens. Our [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|plan]] is to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] you all [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] in September, after a week’s [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] starting on the 2nd, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] we’ll [[20_Vocabulary/be timetabling|be timetabling]] you for [[20_Vocabulary/duties|duties]] the following week from the 9th [[20_Vocabulary/onward|onward]]. Later in the week beginning September 23rd we have a chat with each of you to find out how you [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] a volunteer [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] what [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] you need. As a thank you to the volunteers we [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arrange]] an [[20_Vocabulary/annual event|annual event]]. In recent years we’ve had a party in the Town [[20_Vocabulary/hall|Hall]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|last]] year a [[20_Vocabulary/barbecue|barbecue]] in Chamber Park. Our [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|forthcoming event]] is a trip along the [[20_Vocabulary/canal|canal]] from here to Dewhurst [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] back. It’s on Saturday, September the 28th. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you’d [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|attend]], you can [[20_Vocabulary/recruit|sign up]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] you start work. Now, this is the Volunteer’s T-shirt.

**COLIN** Me [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]], Rosie. I’ll tell you what, let’s [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] aspects of [[20_Vocabulary/human geography|human geography]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] see [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we can [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|narrow the topic down]] a bit to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] us decide.

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|Suppose]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]]. How [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]]? I’d never thought [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the links between that [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] geography until Professor Lee gave us that [[20_Vocabulary/lecture|lecture]] on [[20_Vocabulary/cholera|cholera]].

**ROSIE** I not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it might be best to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] it

**COLIN** OK. [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|Maybe]] we could do something on culture. We had that [[20_Vocabulary/lecture|lecture]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] culture [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] geography [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|last]] week.

**ROSIE** I didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] much [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] that. It was all [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] general [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the [[20_Vocabulary/lecture|lecturer]] didn’t give any [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]] examples.

**COLIN** Yeah, I hardly took any notes. It didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|seem]] [[20_Vocabulary/worth keeping|worth it]].

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/Me neither|Me neither]].

**COLIN** We could [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|focus]] on [[20_Vocabulary/impoverish|poverty]]. That’s something that’s a global problem.

**ROSIE** The [[20_Vocabulary/bother|trouble]] is, Dr Lee was saying, that you have to be careful with some of the [[20_Vocabulary/statistic|figures]] relating to [[20_Vocabulary/impoverish|poverty]]. They’re sometimes [[20_Vocabulary/deliberately|deliberately]] [[20_Vocabulary/manipulate|manipulated]].

**COLIN** You [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] the information gets changed for political reasons?

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|That sort of thing]], yes.

*Before you hear the [[20_Vocabulary/relax|rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discussion]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 26 to 30. you Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 26 to 30.*

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] what are we [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] do our [[20_Vocabulary/placement|assignment]] on? I’ll tell you what. One of the [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possibilities]] we have discussed is [[20_Vocabulary/urbanisation|urbanisation]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] now [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] half the world [[20_Vocabulary/population density|population]] lives in cities. That [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]]

**COLIN** OK good idea Rosie Let do that

**ROSIE** I love living in a big [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] of course there are problems

**COLIN** Things [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/theft|theft]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/robbery|robbery]]?

**ROSIE** Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] where I [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] from, that’s linked to another more serious issue, which is that a lot of people don’t have jobs. That’s getting worse [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] worse. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] we [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] still have quite a lot of people who are homeless, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] that’s not quite [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] bad as it was.

**COLIN** It [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be nice to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] some [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|positive]] developments, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] some of the new developments on the [[20_Vocabulary/outskirt|outskirts]] of cities.

**ROSIE** Yeah, they’ve opened some [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|massive]] new shopping centres [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|outside]] my [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]].

**COLIN** Yeah, the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] with [[20_Vocabulary/mining|mine]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it means a lot of the shops in the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] centre are closing down. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] the [[20_Vocabulary/outskirt|outskirts]] are ideal for buildings that need a lot of space, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] for conferences. They’ve opened a couple of big ones.

**ROSIE** Yes, we’ve got some [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. It’d be nicer to have more [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]] for things [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] football [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that’s not happening where I live.

**COLIN** [[20_Vocabulary/identical|Same]] in my area.

**ROSIE** We could [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] something [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/making progress|developing]] disused [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industrial]] [[20_Vocabulary/several venues|sites]]. It seems [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] a good idea because you’re not doing any [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] to the natural [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]].

**COLIN** Yeah, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] aren’t the buildings [[20_Vocabulary/architecturally|architecturally]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]]?

**ROSIE** Not [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] what people forget is that they often [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] quite dangerous [[20_Vocabulary/material|materials]], chemicals

[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] things, which haven’t been properly cleared [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] the whole site has to be made safe.

**COLIN** Hmm, that can’t be cheap. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] I bet it’s often not budgeted for.

**ROSIE** You’re right.

**COLIN** Have you read [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] Masdar [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|City]]?

**ROSIE** In Abu Dhabi? Yes. It was [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to be a [[20_Vocabulary/biodegradable|green]] [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]], wasn’t it? That might be a good [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] of a [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] which [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] out to depend entirely on [[20_Vocabulary/renewable energy|renewable energy]].

**COLIN** Yes we should say something [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that It was [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to be totally [[20_Vocabulary/pedestrianised|pedestrianised]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] wasn’t it with the transport underground

**ROSIE** Yes [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they had big plans for [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] to [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|reduce]] [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] to the lowest [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] level [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] let’s [[20_Vocabulary/cling|stick]] to talking [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] power sources.

**COLIN** Then there’s that ecotown in England, Greenhill Abbotts. It [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] out to conform to the [[20_Vocabulary/average|usual]] [[20_Vocabulary/principle|principles]], [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|sustainability]] [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|and so on]]. A lot of people were against it at first. They said the plans were [[20_Vocabulary/unrealistic|unrealistic]]. I’m not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] how far they’ve got with it. I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]].

**ROSIE** Right. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] it [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] as [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we have a sort of [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|plan]].

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

[[30_Structures/There are trends in food much as there are trends in clothing|There are trends in food much as there are trends in clothing]]. Interest in food fashions has risen rapidly since the birth of the smartphone when people first began taking photos of their food [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/immediately|instantly]] sharing them with their friends. The food [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]] in the UK [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|in particular]] is [[20_Vocabulary/obsessed with|obsessed with]] finding [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/exploiting|exploiting]] the next big food trend. Marketeers [[20_Vocabulary/objective|aim]] to [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] a [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] demand for a food item which was [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|previously]] unknown or not needed. One of the most [[20_Vocabulary/effective|effective]] ways of [[20_Vocabulary/promote|promoting]] a new food product is by using [[20_Vocabulary/social media|social media]] influencers as [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] [[20_Vocabulary/ambassador|ambassadors]] In return for free samples many influencers [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|post]] [[20_Vocabulary/comfortable|content]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a product [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] there are influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers who [[20_Vocabulary/can command|can command]] large fees for their [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|services]] Companies which sell [[20_Vocabulary/vegan|vegan]] [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] were [[20_Vocabulary/pioneers|pioneers]] in [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/build up|increase]] sales [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] quickly [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|in this way]]. For a food item to become [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]], it has [[20_Vocabulary/to be readily available|to be readily available]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] supermarkets have a role to play in [[20_Vocabulary/invent|creating]] a new food trend. They have [[20_Vocabulary/commit|dedicated]] teams closely following which new [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] or [[20_Vocabulary/ingredient|ingredients]] are trending on [[20_Vocabulary/social media|social media]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested in]] what [[20_Vocabulary/well known|well-known]] chefs are putting on their menus. I’d [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at a few examples of [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|marketing]] [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaigns]] which were [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/effective|successful]] in launching a new fashion trend. Starting in the 1990s with the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]]. A British PR [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] was hired to raise its profile [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|stimulate]] demand. They paid for a group of journalists to travel out to South Africa to meet [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] farmers. Articles written following this visit helped to educate the British [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]], which at this time was [[20_Vocabulary/uncertain|certainly]] not the daily staple it’s since become. Advertisements were [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to [[20_Vocabulary/promote|promote]] the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] as [[20_Vocabulary/a superfood|a superfood]], rich in [[20_Vocabulary/nutrition|nutrients]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|therefore]] [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|beneficial for]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]]. [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|Avocados]] became [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|hugely]] [[20_Vocabulary/fashionable|fashionable]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] within a few years UK [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] sales had grown from £13 million annually to [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] £150 million, making it one of the most [[20_Vocabulary/effective|successful]] [[20_Vocabulary/brand new|fresh]] [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaigns]] in UK history. [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|Oat milk]] is a recent [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] of a new product which became [[20_Vocabulary/fashionable|fashionable]] very quickly. Now there are many [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brands]] available [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] one [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] which had early [[20_Vocabulary/a sense of achievement|success]] was the Swedish [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] Oatly They attracted a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/attention|attention]] with a media [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaign]] which [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] [[20_Vocabulary/provocation|provocation]] as a way of getting their message across [[20_Vocabulary/effective|effectively]]. The fact that this [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaign]] [[20_Vocabulary/aggravated competitors|aggravated competitors]] producing milk from [[20_Vocabulary/dairy cow|dairy cows]] was seen as a [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|plus]], as it helped to make [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|oat milk]] [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|seem]] cool. In the USA, the [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] decided against a big retail [[20_Vocabulary/launch in favour|launch in favour]] of getting the product into coffee chains, which [[20_Vocabulary/remove|removed]] the need for a big [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|advertising]] budget. This [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|proved]] [[30_Structures/far more effective than|far more effective than]] offering samples in supermarkets. [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|Oat milk]] had an [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|advantage]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] other alternative milk [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]], [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] [[20_Vocabulary/almond milk|almond milk]]. Many consumers prefer it because it has less of an [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]]. It requires [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|significantly]] less water to [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] than other alternative milk [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] has a [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] low [[20_Vocabulary/carbon footprint|carbon footprint]]. Norwegian scray, [[20_Vocabulary/a rarely available seasonal fish delicacy|a rarely available seasonal fish delicacy]], [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|otherwise]] known as [[20_Vocabulary/Arctic cod|Arctic cod]], is now [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] on the menus of Michelin-starred restaurants [[20_Vocabulary/throughout|throughout]] Europe. The demand for Skre has been [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] by a food [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|marketing]] [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|agency]] to [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] the [[20_Vocabulary/reputation|reputation]] of Norway’s fisheries [[20_Vocabulary/generally speaking|in general]]. [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|Marketing]] surveys have shown that a [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]] number of shoppers now [[20_Vocabulary/associate|associate]] Norway with [[20_Vocabulary/excell|excellent]] seafood. Food trends can be considered a good thing in some ways, as they can [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|benefit]] farmers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] food producers [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|enormously]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] can [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] be encouraged to buy things which are more sustainably produced. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] ethical concerns have been raised [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the effects [[20_Vocabulary/a surge|a surge]] in demand can [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|cause]]. Quinoa is a classic [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]]. This plant is native to Peru [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] when demand peaked some years ago the [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] [[20_Vocabulary/soar|soared]] making it [[20_Vocabulary/unaffordable|unaffordable]] for [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] people. [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|While]] the popularity of quinoa has benefited farmers [[20_Vocabulary/financial|financially]] there have been other negative consequences. As demand grew, farmers began [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] the land all year round in [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] to [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] more quinoa. One issue has been that the [[20_Vocabulary/fertility|fertility]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] decreased dramatically. which could [[20_Vocabulary/potentially|potentially]] [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|lead to]] [[20_Vocabulary/desertification|desertification]] in some areas. Another [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be the case of…
