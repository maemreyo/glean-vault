### PART 1

**WOMAN** It's really good to see you, Tom. Since I had to give up work, I feel I'm losing touch with my friends and colleagues.

**MAN** We really miss you in the office. We were all so sorry you had to leave. But you must be relieved to have more time to look after your mother. How is she?

**WOMAN** Well she is very cheerful, but she needs a lot of help.

**MAN** Have you tried to get any support from the local [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]]?

**WOMAN** No, I didn't know I could.

**MAN** Yes, they offer different kinds of practical support. They realise that carers sometimes need time for all the other responsibilities they have, [[20_Vocabulary/Apart from|apart from]] the person they're [[20_Vocabulary/caring|caring]] for, and also that they sometimes need a break.

**WOMAN** Absolutely. OK, so tell me more. How do I go about getting this support?

**MAN** Well, you'd have to have an [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]] of your mother's needs. That means someone would come round and talk to you about the situation and what you need. So, for a start, they'd want to know the amount of time you spend looking after your mother every day.

**WOMAN** OK.

**MAN** Then they'll [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] ask you what sorts of tasks you do for your mother during the day. Things like if she needs help with getting dressed, for example.

**WOMAN** Right. I help her with that. And also I help her get into the shower in the morning.

**MAN** Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|that sort of thing]].

**WOMAN** Yes, that's becoming a bit of a problem. She used to be very good at it, but not anymore.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions five to ten. you Now listen and answer questions 5 to 10.*

**MAN** And be ready to tell them about anything you find [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] difficult about [[20_Vocabulary/caring|caring]] for your mother.

**WOMAN** So, recently I've noticed she's started to have quite bad problems with her memory. If I wasn't there, I think she'd forget to eat, for example. And often she doesn't seem quite sure what day it is.

MAN Yes, tell them about that. And are there any physical difficulties you have [[20_Vocabulary/caring|caring]] for her? Lifting her, for example?

**WOMAN** Yes, she's quite heavy and I'm afraid of hurting my back. I'd be in real trouble if that happened.

**MAN** They can give you advice about that and also about how to avoid the possibility of your mum having a fall.

**WOMAN** Great. So once they've done this [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]], if I'm eligible, what happens next?

**MAN** Well, they might support you financially. So they might help you with transport costs, like if you have to get a taxi to take your mother for an appointment, for example.

**WOMAN** I usually drive her myself, [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]]. So, could I [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claim]] the petrol?

**MAN** You could. And you can [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claim]] for the insurance too.

**WOMAN** Oh, right.

**MAN** And if you need help with the housework, they can [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arrange]] for someone to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|come along]] once or twice a week. And one other thing. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but it important you

look after yourself And it seems to me you under quite a bit of [[20_Vocabulary/stress|stress]]

**WOMAN** I am yes

**MAN** Well tell the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] because they may be able to give you some advice on how to minimise it

**WOMAN** Really? Though, [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]], I feel so much better having talked to you. I'll get in touch with the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] straight away. Now, shall we go for coffee or something?

### PART 2

Good morning everyone. I'm Steve Wainwright from Elmley Town [[20_Vocabulary/council|Council]] and I organise the town's volunteer [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|scheme]]. I'm delighted you're all interested in joining the [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|scheme]]. Our volunteers help to create [[20_Vocabulary/a sense of community|a sense of community]] among the many people who live in our historic town of Elmley and make residents and visitors feel welcome at local events. First, I'll mention just a few of the activities that volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/carry out|carry out]]. 

One is to walk around the town centre streets wearing our volunteer T-shirt. Tourists often ask how to get to a particular shop, and they might also be [[20_Vocabulary/grateful|grateful]] for recommendations about what to visit. 

The town holds a large number of concerts each year and part of the volunteers' role is to get everyone in the [[20_Vocabulary/audience|audience]] to the right place as [[20_Vocabulary/smoothly|smoothly]] as possible. You'd be surprised how many people buy tickets, then don't check them, and [[20_Vocabulary/head for|head for]] the wrong section of the [[20_Vocabulary/hall|hall]]. 

Volunteers may get involved with community groups, such as sports clubs or gardeners' associations. Here, the volunteers [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] how groups can help each other. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For instance]], a writing group might want to travel to another town to hear a talk by a well- known author, but may not know that another club has a coach they could travel in. 

The town produces a monthly magazine, and anyone who lives in the town can send in articles. It's free to residents and is paid for by local businesses. That's the responsibility of the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]]'s advertising department we [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|depend on]] volunteers though to find out what people think of events they've attended and any suggestions they have for the future, the volunteers then send a summary to the editors. 

There are a number of clubs for retired people and every year the [[20_Vocabulary/council|council]] arranges lunch for all the members the volunteers welcome the guests and when everyone's sitting down and relaxing after the [[20_Vocabulary/meal|meal]], some volunteers put on a show. Usually around half an hour of songs and short plays, the club members really welcome the chance to chat to the volunteers at these events. 

[[20_Vocabulary/the town council|The town council]] has a website, of course, and volunteers are asked to help by making sure residents know about it It updated every day with information about future activities and we want as many people as possible to use it.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the talk, you have some time to look at questions 17 to 20. Now listen and answer questions 17 to 20. OK, now you know some of the things our volunteers do, I'll [[20_Vocabulary/go on|go on]] to some practical matters.*

As you [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] know, the town arranges three major festivals every year, and they all [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|depend on]] a large number of volunteers. The book festival [[20_Vocabulary/lasts three days|lasts three days]], and uses [[20_Vocabulary/several venues|several venues]] which all need volunteers. More are needed for the music festival because that [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|lasts]] a whole week, and even more help is required for the science festival, even though it's only two days long. It involves quite a lot of venues, though. It's a good idea to help at the festival you're most interested in, because you can attend most of the events for free. 

We try to use volunteers who are flexible, though, because some festival events are held outdoors and the weather may [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] the size of the [[20_Vocabulary/audience|audience]] and even whether the event can [[20_Vocabulary/take place|take place]] so there can be changes at short notice What [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] though is being able to get on well with other people and also to deal with someone who's behaving badly, as occasionally happens. 

Our plan is to get you all working in September, after a week's training starting on the 2nd, so we'll [[20_Vocabulary/be timetabling|be timetabling]] you for [[20_Vocabulary/duties|duties]] the following week from the 9th [[20_Vocabulary/onward|onward]]. Later in the week beginning September 23rd we have a chat with each of you to find out how you feel about being a volunteer and what extra support you need. 

As a thank you to the volunteers we [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arrange]] an [[20_Vocabulary/annual event|annual event]]. In recent years we've had a party in the Town [[20_Vocabulary/hall|Hall]] and last year a [[20_Vocabulary/barbecue|barbecue]] in Chamber Park. Our [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|forthcoming event]] is a trip along the [[20_Vocabulary/canal|canal]] from here to Dewhurst and back. It's on Saturday, September the 28th. And if you'd like to attend, you can sign up once you start work. Now, this is the Volunteer's T-shirt.

### PART 3

**ROSIE** Colin, I'm really [[20_Vocabulary/struggling|struggling]] to think of a topic for our [[20_Vocabulary/human geography|human geography]] assignment.

**COLIN** Me too, Rosie. I'll tell you what, let's think about the different aspects of [[20_Vocabulary/human geography|human geography]] and see if we can [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|narrow the topic down]] a bit to help us decide.

**ROSIE** OK. So one aspect is population. That would be all about [[20_Vocabulary/population density|population density]] and migration and so on. Lots of facts and statistics. Maybe a bit boring?

**COLIN** Yeah, but quite straightforward to find on the internet.

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|Suppose so]]. How about health? I'd never thought about the links between that and geography until Professor Lee gave us that [[20_Vocabulary/lecture|lecture]] on [[20_Vocabulary/cholera|cholera]]. How in the 19th century, [[20_Vocabulary/a physician|a physician]] used street plans and plans of water supplies to find the source of [[20_Vocabulary/a cholera epidemic|a cholera epidemic]].

**COLIN** Yes, fascinating, wasn't it? Or we could do something more general like economies

**ROSIE** So how [[20_Vocabulary/financial|financial]] and [[20_Vocabulary/commercial|commercial]] factors are linked to the physical environment

**COLIN** Yeah

**ROSIE** I thought that had been taken off the [[20_Vocabulary/syllabus|syllabus]] for this year

**COLIN** Has it

**ROSIE** I not sure but it might be best to avoid it

**COLIN** OK. Maybe we could do something on culture. We had that [[20_Vocabulary/lecture|lecture]] about culture and geography last week.

**ROSIE** I didn't [[20_Vocabulary/get much out of that|get much out of that]]. It was all so general and the lecturer didn't give any useful examples.

**COLIN** Yeah, I hardly took any notes. It didn't seem [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] it.

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/Me neither|Me neither]].

**COLIN** We could focus on poverty. That's something that's a global problem.

**ROSIE** The trouble is, Dr Lee was saying, that you have to be careful with some of the figures relating to poverty. They're sometimes [[20_Vocabulary/deliberately|deliberately]] manipulated.

**COLIN** You mean the information gets changed for political reasons?

**ROSIE** [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|That sort of thing]], yes.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 26 to 30. you Now listen and answer questions 26 to 30.*

**ROSIE** So what are we going to do our assignment on? I'll tell you what. One of the possibilities we have discussed is [[20_Vocabulary/urbanisation|urbanisation]] and now over half the world population lives in cities. That really important

**COLIN** OK good idea Rosie Let do that

**ROSIE** I love living in a big city but of course there are problems

**COLIN** Things like [[20_Vocabulary/theft|theft]] and [[20_Vocabulary/robbery|robbery]]?

**ROSIE** Yes, but where I come from, that's linked to another more serious issue, which is that a lot of people don't have jobs. That's getting worse and worse. And we also still have quite a lot of people who are homeless, though that's not quite so bad as it was.

**COLIN** It would be nice to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] some positive developments, like some of the new developments on the outskirts of cities.

**ROSIE** Yeah, they've opened some massive new shopping centres outside my city.

**COLIN** Yeah, the same with mine, but it means a lot of the shops in the city centre are closing down. But the outskirts are ideal for buildings that need a lot of space, like for conferences. They've opened a couple of big ones.

**ROSIE** Yes, we've got some too. It'd be nicer to have more [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]] for things like football too, but that's not happening where I live.

**COLIN** Same in my area.

**ROSIE** We could include something about developing disused industrial sites. It seems like a good idea because you're not doing any [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] to the natural environment.

**COLIN** Yeah, but aren't the buildings [[20_Vocabulary/architecturally|architecturally]] significant?

**ROSIE** Not really. And what people forget is that they often used quite dangerous materials, chemicals and things, which haven't been properly cleared away, so the whole site has to be made safe.

**COLIN** Hmm, that can't be cheap. And I bet it's often not budgeted for.

**ROSIE** You're right.

**COLIN** Have you read about Masdar City?

**ROSIE** In Abu Dhabi? Yes. It was designed to be a green city, wasn't it? That might be a good example of a city which set out to depend entirely on [[20_Vocabulary/renewable energy|renewable energy]].

**COLIN** Yes we should say something about that It was designed to be totally [[20_Vocabulary/pedestrianised|pedestrianised]] too wasn't it with the transport underground

**ROSIE** Yes and they had big plans for recycling to reduce waste to the lowest possible level But let's stick to talking about power sources.

**COLIN** Then there's that ecotown in England, Greenhill Abbotts. It set out to conform to the usual principles, sustainability and so on. A lot of people were against it at first. They said the plans were [[20_Vocabulary/unrealistic|unrealistic]]. I'm not sure how far they've got with it. I'll check.

**ROSIE** Right. So it looks as if we have a sort of plan.

### PART 4

[[30_Structures/There are trends in food much as there are trends in clothing|There are trends in food much as there are trends in clothing]]. Interest in food fashions has risen rapidly since the birth of the smartphone when people first began taking photos of their food and instantly sharing them with their friends. The food industry in the UK in particular is [[20_Vocabulary/obsessed with|obsessed with]] finding and [[20_Vocabulary/exploiting|exploiting]] the next big food trend. Marketeers aim to create a huge demand for a food item which was previously unknown or not needed. One of the most [[20_Vocabulary/effective|effective]] ways of promoting a new food product is by using [[20_Vocabulary/social media|social media]] influencers as [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] ambassadors In return for free samples many influencers [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] post content about a product although there are influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers who [[20_Vocabulary/can command|can command]] large fees for their services Companies which sell [[20_Vocabulary/vegan|vegan]] [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] were [[20_Vocabulary/pioneers|pioneers]] in being able to increase sales really quickly in this way. For a food item to become really popular, it has [[20_Vocabulary/to be readily available|to be readily available]]. So supermarkets have a role to play in creating a new food trend. They have dedicated teams closely following which new products or ingredients are trending on [[20_Vocabulary/social media|social media]] and are [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] interested in what well-known chefs are putting on their menus. I'd like to look at a few examples of marketing campaigns which were really successful in launching a new fashion trend. Starting in the 1990s with the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]]. A British PR company was hired to raise its profile and stimulate demand. They paid for a group of journalists to travel out to South Africa to meet [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] farmers. Articles written following this visit helped to educate the British public about the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]], which at this time was certainly not the daily staple it's since become. Advertisements were designed to [[20_Vocabulary/promote|promote]] the [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] as [[20_Vocabulary/a superfood|a superfood]], rich in nutrients and therefore [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|beneficial]] for health. Avocados became [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|hugely]] [[20_Vocabulary/fashionable|fashionable]], and within a few years UK [[20_Vocabulary/avocado|avocado]] sales had grown from £13 million annually to around £150 million, making it one of the most successful fresh [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] campaigns in UK history. [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|Oat milk]] is a recent example of a new product which became [[20_Vocabulary/fashionable|fashionable]] very quickly. Now there are many brands available but one company which had early success was the Swedish [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] Oatly They attracted a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/attention|attention]] with a media [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaign]] which used [[20_Vocabulary/provocation|provocation]] as a way of getting their message across effectively. The fact that this [[20_Vocabulary/campaign|campaign]] [[20_Vocabulary/aggravated competitors|aggravated competitors]] producing milk from dairy cows was seen as a plus, as it helped to make [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|oat milk]] seem cool. In the USA, the [[20_Vocabulary/brand|brand]] decided against a big retail [[20_Vocabulary/launch in favour|launch in favour]] of getting the product into coffee chains, which removed the need for a big advertising budget. This proved [[30_Structures/far more effective than|far more effective than]] offering samples in supermarkets. [[20_Vocabulary/Oat milk|Oat milk]] had an advantage over other alternative milk products, such as [[20_Vocabulary/almond milk|almond milk]]. Many consumers prefer it because it has less of an [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] on the environment. It requires significantly less water to [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] than other alternative milk products and it also has a [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] low [[20_Vocabulary/carbon footprint|carbon footprint]]. Norwegian scray, [[20_Vocabulary/a rarely available seasonal fish delicacy|a rarely available seasonal fish delicacy]], [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|otherwise]] known as [[20_Vocabulary/Arctic cod|Arctic cod]], is now found on the menus of Michelin-starred restaurants [[20_Vocabulary/throughout|throughout]] Europe. The demand for Skre has been used by a food marketing agency to build the [[20_Vocabulary/reputation|reputation]] of Norway's fisheries in general. Marketing surveys have shown that a significant number of shoppers now [[20_Vocabulary/associate|associate]] Norway with excellent seafood. Food trends can be considered a good thing in some ways, as they can benefit farmers and food producers enormously. The public can also be encouraged to buy things which are more sustainably produced. But ethical concerns have been raised about the effects [[20_Vocabulary/a surge|a surge]] in demand can cause. Quinoa is a classic example. This plant is native to Peru and when demand peaked some years ago the price soared making it [[20_Vocabulary/unaffordable|unaffordable]] for local people. While the popularity of quinoa has benefited farmers financially there have been other negative consequences. As demand grew, farmers began working the land all year round in order to [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] more quinoa. One issue has been that the [[20_Vocabulary/fertility|fertility]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] decreased dramatically. which could [[20_Vocabulary/potentially|potentially]] lead to [[20_Vocabulary/desertification|desertification]] in some areas. Another example would be the case of…
