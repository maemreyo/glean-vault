### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 1

KAEDEN: Hello Charlotte. I’m Kaeden, one of the [[20_Vocabulary/supervisor|supervisors]]. Welcome to the team.

Exam preparation [[20_Vocabulary/material|materials]]

CHARLOTTE: Hi Aiden.

KAEDEN: It’s Kaeden. ***Q1***

CHARLOTTE: I’m [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/regret|sorry]].

KAEDEN: Don’t [[20_Vocabulary/bother|worry]]. People often [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] my name wrong; they never know how to [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spell]] it. It’s K-A-E-D-E-N, in case you ever need to write it.

CHARLOTTE: I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]].

KAEDEN: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], there are a few practical things you need to sort out this morning. Then I’ll [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] you what you’re [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] do today.

CHARLOTTE: The email I received said to go to the front desk, to [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] my letter of appointment [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/plectrums|pick]] up my [[20_Vocabulary/badge|badge]].

KAEDEN: You’ll need that for the staffroom [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other areas of the supermarket where shoppers aren’t allowed. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], after you’ve finished at the front desk, I’ll take you to the staffroom. Put your [[20_Vocabulary/coat|coat]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/rucksack|rucksack]] in one of the [[20_Vocabulary/locker|lockers]] there. Take whichever one is free. ***Q2***

CHARLOTTE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Will]] I have a key?

KAEDEN: Yes. [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|Try]] not to lose it. At the end of the day, leave it in the [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|door]] for the next person to use.

CHARLOTTE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Will]] do.

KAEDEN: You [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] need to go to the HR [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|department]] to see Tiffany. She’s [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]].

CHARLOTTE: I was told to bring my passport with me. HR need to take a note of the number in it. ***Q3***

KAEDEN: That’s right. Or you can [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] your ID card.

CHARLOTTE: I don’t have one of those.

KAEDEN: OK. Tiffany [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] give you a [[20_Vocabulary/apron|uniform]]. They have lots in [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] sizes, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] you just tell her what you need. I won’t [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] with you to HR – I’ve got to go [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sort something else out. Problem with a bread slicer. ***Q4***

CHARLOTTE: Is the HR office near the staffroom?

KAEDEN: The staffroom’s on the first floor, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] HR are a couple of floors [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|above]] that, on the third floor. There’s a [[20_Vocabulary/stair|staircase]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|outside]] the staffroom. ***Q5***

CHARLOTTE: OK.

KAEDEN: When you’ve finished with HR, [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] find me in the [[20_Vocabulary/bakery|bakery]] [[20_Vocabulary/segment|section]] of the shop.

CHARLOTTE: I’m looking forward to getting started.

KAEDEN: I’ll just give you my phone number, in case you can’t find me. Have you got your phone there?

CHARLOTTE: Yes … OK, ready.

KAEDEN: It’s oh-four-one-two double-six-five nine-oh-three. ***Q6***

CHARLOTTE: OK, done.

—————————-

KAEDEN: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], Charlotte, your tasks today are in the [[20_Vocabulary/bakery|bakery]] [[20_Vocabulary/segment|section]], on [[20_Vocabulary/the sushi counter|the sushi counter]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] on the meat [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] fish counters. The first job is to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] sell-by dates on the bread [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] cakes. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] any of the dates are today’s, put a new [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] [[20_Vocabulary/badge|label]] on the [[20_Vocabulary/packaging|packaging]].

CHARLOTTE: What [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] any of the labels are yesterday’s dates, or older? Do I throw those [[20_Vocabulary/agenda|items]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]]?

KAEDEN: Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that shouldn’t [[20_Vocabulary/take place|happen]] – we [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] the [[20_Vocabulary/goods|stock]] every day. When something needs a new [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] [[20_Vocabulary/badge|label]], put a yellow one on the [[20_Vocabulary/packaging|package]], next to the original [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]]. ***Q7***

CHARLOTTE: OK.

KAEDEN: After that, you’ll go to the sushi takeaway counter.

CHARLOTTE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Will]] I be preparing boxes of food?

KAEDEN: For today, you’ll just be helping the staff.

CHARLOTTE: Yes, of course.

KAEDEN: You’ll see lots of flat cardboard boxes at one end of the counter. [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|Beneath]] those is where we [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] the plastic boxes -we [[20_Vocabulary/run out of|run out of]] those [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] quickly, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] you should bring more from the storeroom. ***Q8***

CHARLOTTE: Is that my [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] task on [[20_Vocabulary/the sushi counter|the sushi counter]]?

KAEDEN: No. You [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] need to clean the area where they [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|prepare]] the dishes. There are cloths [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] bottles of [[20_Vocabulary/spray|spray]] by the [[20_Vocabulary/sink|sink]]. Oh, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] please make [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you clean that [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

CHARLOTTE: [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|Sure]]. That’s [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]], isn’t it?

KAEDEN: [[20_Vocabulary/Unquestionably|Absolutely]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] you mustn’t wash up knives. You have to do some [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] before you’re allowed to touch [[20_Vocabulary/sharp object|sharp objects]].

CHARLOTTE: What should I do [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] there are any?

KAEDEN: Ask someone to put them in the dishwasher.

CHARLOTTE: OK, thanks. I don’t want to [[20_Vocabulary/get anything wrong|get anything wrong]].

KAEDEN: Don’t [[20_Vocabulary/bother|worry]]. You’ll be fine. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] I’ll be [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]].

CHARLOTTE: Right.

KAEDEN: [[20_Vocabulary/Lastly|Finally]], the meat [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] fish counters. You need to clean the area where staff [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serve]] customers, including wiping the weighing scales.

CHARLOTTE: OK. Anything else?

KAEDEN: The fish is laid on ice, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] when that starts to melt, you’ll need to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] more from the cold-room. ***Q9***

CHARLOTTE: I know the staff on the food counters [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] a hat. [[20_Vocabulary/will|Will]] that be the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] for me?

KAEDEN: You won’t be [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serving]] customers [[20_Vocabulary/immediately|directly]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] no. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] make [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you put on [[20_Vocabulary/thermal glove|thermal gloves]] when you take anything [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] the cold-room. The temperature’s low enough in there to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/frostbite|frostbite]] from touching things. ***Q10***

CHARLOTTE: Understood.

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

My name’s Liz Fuller [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I’m a running [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|coach]] with Compton Park Runners Club.

Welcome to my podcast. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you’re thinking [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/taking up running|taking up running]] – I’m here to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]].

There are many [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] programmes available online which [[20_Vocabulary/objective|aim]] to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] people [[20_Vocabulary/build up|build up]] to running 5 kilometres. Some of them are great [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] thousands of people of all ages are taking [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|part]] in 5-kilometre races across the country [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|as a result]]. People [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] them because they’re easy to [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|follow]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] don’t push them [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] hard. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], they don’t [[20_Vocabulary/serve|work for]] everyone – [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|especially]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you [[20_Vocabulary/suffer from|suffer from]] something [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/a heart condition|a heart condition]] or [[20_Vocabulary/asthma|asthma]], because they’re [[20_Vocabulary/meant|aimed]] at people with [[20_Vocabulary/average fitness|average fitness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] running [[20_Vocabulary/capable|ability]]. Another thing is that everyone is [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you have any specific questions [[20_Vocabulary/associate|related to]] your needs, there’s no one to provide any answers. ***Q11/12***

I have a couple of simple tips I always give to new runners. I expect you’ve been told to run very slowly until your fitness increases – well, I find that can [[20_Vocabulary/prevent progress|prevent progress]]. You should run at a speed that [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feels]] [[20_Vocabulary/comfortable|comfortable]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] time yourself [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] to run a bit faster each time. Listening to music can be very [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]] – [[20_Vocabulary/it takes your mind off things|it takes your mind off things]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] helps your [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|body]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] into [[20_Vocabulary/a rhythm|a rhythm]]. I’d say that is better than running with a friend – [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|especially]] as most people are competitive [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that’s not what you want when you’re just starting. I don’t [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] the time of day is [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|especially]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] – some people are better in the evening, [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] others are morning people – [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] you need to be [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|consistent]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/objective|aim]] to train [[20_Vocabulary/regularly|regularly]] -twice a week is enough to begin with. ***Q13/14***

————————————————

New members often say to me that they’ve been put off running either because they [[20_Vocabulary/absence|lack]] confidence, or they don’t have time, or they [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] they dislike running. Ceri, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]], joined the club two years ago at the age of 40. She’d always [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoyed]] running at school [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] wasn’t [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] she’d be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to do it. She was [[20_Vocabulary/upset|worried]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/left behind|left behind]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] the slowest runner. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] she says she was made to [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] welcome she soon forgot all [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that. ***Q15***

James had always hated the idea of running [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] a friend encouraged him to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|come along]] for [[20_Vocabulary/a taster session|a taster session]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he hasn’t looked back. He never misses a [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|training session]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|despite]] having a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] demanding job. ***Q16***

Leo was [[20_Vocabulary/upset|worried]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] having to [[20_Vocabulary/commit|commit]] himself to [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] sessions every week [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] wasn’t [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] he’d be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to fit [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] into his busy [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|schedule]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] after [[20_Vocabulary/undergone|experiencing]] a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/stress|stress]] at work he came along to us [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] gave it a go. Now he says he [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feels]] much more [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relaxed]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] forward to his weekly run. ***Q17***

[[20_Vocabulary/mark|Mark]] is quite [[20_Vocabulary/average|typical]] of our new members. [[30_Structures/He’s never considered himself to|He’s never considered himself to]] be a sporty person [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it was [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] when he [[20_Vocabulary/retire|retired]] that he decided to [[20_Vocabulary/take up the challenge|take up the challenge]] of [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|trying]] to run 5 kilometres. It took him months to find the [[20_Vocabulary/spine|courage]] to contact us [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|felt]] [[20_Vocabulary/reassuring|reassured]] [[20_Vocabulary/immediately|immediately]] as there were other people his age who were [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] just [[20_Vocabulary/taking up running|taking up running]] for the first time. ***Q18***

My own [[20_Vocabulary/boat trip|journey]] hasn’t been easy. I did my first marathon when I was 37, after having had two kids. My husband had been running marathons for years, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I never dreamed I ’d be doing one with him. I managed to complete it in four hours, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|felt]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] giving up halfway through -it was [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] the [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] of the spectators that kept me going. ***Q19***

I do [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] signing up for a race of whatever length is motivating – whether it’s 5K or 25K – because it’s good to have something to [[20_Vocabulary/take steps to|work towards]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it gives you [[20_Vocabulary/a sense of achievement|a sense of achievement]]. I did my first 10K after [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] six months, which was [[20_Vocabulary/uncertain|certainly]] very challenging [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] not something I ’d necessarily [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] after you’ve been [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|training]] for a few weeks, it’s [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] putting your name down for a 5K – some people find they [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] need a few practice runs before taking [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|part]] in a race, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’d give yourself a couple of months at least. ***Q20***

Well, I hope that’s given...

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

KIERAN: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] Jane – you’ll be off to Denmark soon to do your work [[20_Vocabulary/placement|placement]].

JANE: Yes, I’m [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] looking forward to it [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I’ve just started packing up all my books to put in storage.

KIERAN: Well, I hope they don’t [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/spoilt|spoilt]].

JANE: It’s OK – my grandfather works in a bookshop [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he told me how to [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|pack]] them.

KIERAN: Oh, that’s [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]].

JANE: He says you have to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] the [[20_Vocabulary/spine|spine]] [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|otherwise]] the paper can [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] from the cover. ***Q21***

KIERAN: Yeah – that’s [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obvious]].

JANE: He [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] told me to [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|pack]] them flat in the [[20_Vocabulary/packaging|box]] not on their side – [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|again]] because they can [[20_Vocabulary/curve|bend]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you leave them [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] that for, say, a year, it’s quite hard to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] them back to their [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] [[20_Vocabulary/curve|shape]].

KIERAN: Well, it’s pretty clear that [[20_Vocabulary/ruin|ruins]] them, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] a lot of people just can’t be [[20_Vocabulary/bother|bothered]] to protect their books.

JANE: He always says it’s such a shame that publishers don’t use better-[[20_Vocabulary/attribute|quality]] paper.

KIERAN: It’s the [[20_Vocabulary/acid|acid]] in the paper that causes the problem, isn’t it?

JANE: Yeah – that’s why [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] books go yellow. You know some of the books my grandfather’s given me are [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] that already.

KIERAN: Oh...

JANE: I should [[20_Vocabulary/dump|dump]] them [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they’re [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] [[20_Vocabulary/degrade|deteriorate]] further, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’d [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] bad. They’ll always remind me of him. He’s quite a collector, you know. ***Q22***

KIERAN: Well, [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they’re [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to you...

JANE: Yeah – I’d [[20_Vocabulary/regret|regret]] just throwing them [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]].

KIERAN: You know, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] it’s because I was taught to treasure books... [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[30_Structures/I hate seeing students force open the pages – of paperbacks|I hate seeing students force open the pages – of paperbacks]]. They [[20_Vocabulary/press so hard|press so hard]] they end up breaking the [[20_Vocabulary/spine|spine]].

JANE: I know, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/Unfortunately|unfortunately]], paperbacks aren’t [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|last]] a long time [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] people know that. Hardbacks aren’t quite as weak.

KIERAN: Yeah, they’re [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]], I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I still don’t [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] people [[20_Vocabulary/worth|value]] hardbacks [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] they [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to.

JANE: Well, they aren’t [[20_Vocabulary/decorative|decorative]], are they, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] other objects. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|Plus]], nowadays, people don’t [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] them out on [[20_Vocabulary/a shelf|shelves]] as much as they [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to.

KIERAN: That’s such a pity. When I visit someone – [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they have, say, a colorful book on a table, it’s the first thing I’m drawn to. ***Q23***

JANE: I agree – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] book covers can be a work of art in [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|themselves]]. Some are [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/eye-catching|eye-catching]].

KIERAN: I’ve always been taught to [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|handle]] books carefully. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you [[20_Vocabulary/watches|watch]] someone take a book off [[20_Vocabulary/a shelf|a shelf]], well, they usually do it wrong.

JANE: Ah, my grandfather says, you should put your hand right [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] the top of the book... or [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you can’t do that, pull the other books on the [[20_Vocabulary/a shelf|shelf]] aside [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] that you can [[20_Vocabulary/hold|hold]] the whole cover.

KIERAN: When did you learn all this?

JANE: He [[20_Vocabulary/watches|watched]] me pull a heavy book off the [[20_Vocabulary/a shelf|shelf]] when I was [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it fell on the floor [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] broke apart. ***Q24***

KIERAN: [[20_Vocabulary/Oh dear|Oh dear]]!

KIERAN: I can still [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] it!

JANE: You know what I [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]]?

KIERAN: What?

JANE: The smell of new books.

KIERAN: Me [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

JANE: My parents [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to laugh at me when I was a kid because I loved putting books up to my nose. Almost as much as reading them!

KIERAN: New books aren’t cheap, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]], are they? ***Q25***

JANE: I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] we’re lucky we can buy them.

KIERAN: My grandfather stocks [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] books [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] new ones [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they don’t smell quite as good.

——————————————————

KIERAN: I’d love to have a bookshop [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] your grandfather. What’s it [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]]?

JANE: Well, it’s quite big – it’s got two floors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] an attic, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he stocks all kinds of books [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]].

KIERAN: I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] he treasures things [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] first editions [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other rare books.

JANE: Yeah – you might [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] he’d [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] those in the attic or somewhere.

KIERAN:... [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] they’d be hidden?

JANE: Yeah. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] he likes people to know that he has them. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], he puts them out in the shop [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] makes [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you need a ladder to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] them. ***Q26***

KIERAN: Right. That [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|prevent]] any thefts!

JANE: Uhuh.

KIERAN: Does he [[20_Vocabulary/stocks books|stock books]] for children?

JANE: He does. He [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] likes to [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|encourage]] kids to read; he always says that he [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to sit [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] the [[20_Vocabulary/stair|stairs]] as a child with a pile of books [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] read them all.

KIERAN: Is that where he keeps them, then?

JANE: Not [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]] – he’s got [[20_Vocabulary/a dedicated area|a dedicated area]] on the ground floor with [[20_Vocabulary/cushion|cushions]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] that parents can [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|enter]] with their [[20_Vocabulary/toddler|toddlers]], go there [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] spend some time reading to them. ***Q27***

KIERAN: Oh cool.

JANE: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] then there’s a place for pushchairs by the front [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|door]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] a café [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] anyone needs refreshments.

KIERAN: That’s good to know.

JANE: As I said, it’s a big shop [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there’s a storage area out the back [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|as well]].

KIERAN: Oh, what does he [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] there? Books he wants to throw [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]]?

JANE: He hardly ever throws anything [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] – he just leaves [[20_Vocabulary/unwanted book|unwanted books]] by the front [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|door]] for customers to take. ***Q28***

KIERAN: Well, that’s very nice.

JANE: Yeah – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] books people or [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|institutions]] have requested, they all go at [[20_Vocabulary/the far end|the far end]]. ***Q29***

KIERAN: Oh.

JANE: He thinks it’s best to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] these [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] the [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|main]] shopping area as they’re boxed [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] new.

KIERAN: Did you [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] your coursebooks from him?

JANE: Naturally. He [[20_Vocabulary/stocks books|stocks books]] for a lot of the colleges. He [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] these books on the first floor, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] now there’s a new university in my hometown, he’s moved them downstairs to [[20_Vocabulary/attractively|attract]] the students. They’re [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] the coffee shop, on low [[20_Vocabulary/a shelf|shelves]] all [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] it. ***Q30***

KIERAN: Pretty central then. You’ll have to take me there some time!

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

Tree planting now [[20_Vocabulary/dominates political|dominates political]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]] agendas [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] is often [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presented]] as an easy answer to the climate crisis, [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] a way for business corporations to offset their [[20_Vocabulary/carbon emission|carbon emissions]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/Unfortunately|unfortunately]], tree planting isn’t as straightforward as some people [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]]. When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place, it can do [[20_Vocabulary/considerably|considerably]] more [[20_Vocabulary/harm|damage]] than good, failing to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] either people or the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]].

Reforestation projects are currently [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/undertaken on|undertaken on]] a [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] scale in many countries [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/essential|crucial]] that the right trees are selected. A [[20_Vocabulary/a mixture|mix]] of species should always be planted, [[20_Vocabulary/average|typical]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] natural forest ecosystem [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] including rare [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/mass extinction|endangered species]] in [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] to [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] a rich ecosystem. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] [[20_Vocabulary/invasive|non-native]] species that could become [[20_Vocabulary/invasive|invasive]]. [[20_Vocabulary/invasive|Invasive]] species are a [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]] [[20_Vocabulary/participant|contributor]] to [[20_Vocabulary/the current global biodiversity crisis|the current global biodiversity crisis]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are often [[20_Vocabulary/in competition with|in competition with]] [[20_Vocabulary/native fig tree|native species]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] may [[20_Vocabulary/harm|threaten]] their long-term [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survival]]. ***Q31***

Restoring [[20_Vocabulary/appropriate levels of genetic diversity|biodiversity]] that [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/maximise carbon capture|maximise carbon capture]] is key when reforesting an area, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] ideally any [[20_Vocabulary/Large-scale reforestation projects|reforestation project]] should have several goals. These could [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife [[20_Vocabulary/conservation|conservation]], improve the [[20_Vocabulary/to be readily available|availability]] of food for the [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] community ***Q32*** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/keep on|maintain]] the stability of [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] systems. [[20_Vocabulary/conference|Meeting]] as many of these goals as [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]], [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|whilst]] doing no [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] to [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] communities, native ecosystems [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] vulnerable species, is the sign of a highly [[20_Vocabulary/effective|successful]] tree-planting [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|scheme]]. To ensure the [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survival]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|resilience]] of a planted forest, it’s [[20_Vocabulary/essential|vital]] to use tree seeds with [[20_Vocabulary/appropriate levels of genetic diversity|appropriate levels of genetic diversity]]: the amount of [[20_Vocabulary/genetic variation|genetic variation]] [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] within a species [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] for their [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survival]]. Using seeds with low [[20_Vocabulary/appropriate levels of genetic diversity|genetic diversity]] [[20_Vocabulary/generally speaking|generally]] lowers the [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|resilience]] of restored forests, which can make them vulnerable to [[20_Vocabulary/cardiovascular disease|disease]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] unable to adapt to [[20_Vocabulary/carbon emission|climate change]]. ***Q33***

Choosing the right [[20_Vocabulary/placement|location]] for reforestation projects is as [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] as choosing the right trees. [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|Ultimately]], the best area for planting trees [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be in [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|formerly]] forested areas that are in poor condition. It’s better to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] non-forested landscapes [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] natural [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grasslands]], [[20_Vocabulary/savannas|savannas]] or wetlands as these ecosystems already contribute [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|greatly]] to capturing carbon. It [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] be [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|advantageous]] to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] recreational spaces. Reforesting areas which are currently [[20_Vocabulary/exploited for|exploited for]] agriculture should be avoided as this often leads to other areas [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] deforested. ***Q34***

——————————————–

[[20_Vocabulary/Large-scale reforestation projects|Large-scale reforestation projects]] require careful [[20_Vocabulary/be timetabling|planning]]. Making the right decisions [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] where to plant trees depends on having the right information. Having detailed [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] up-to-date maps [[20_Vocabulary/identify|identifying]] high-prioritv areas for [[20_Vocabulary/treatment|intervention]] is [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]]. ***Q35***. [[20_Vocabulary/drone|Drone]] technology is a [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]] tool in helping to prioritise [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] monitor areas of [[20_Vocabulary/degrade|degraded]] forest for restoration. In Brazil, it’s [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to [[20_Vocabulary/identify|identify]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] quantify how parts of the Amazon are [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/devastate|devastated]] by human activities [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] [[20_Vocabulary/rearing cattle|rearing cattle]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/illegal logging|illegal logging]]. ***Q36***

A good [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] of where the right trees were picked to [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|achieve]] a restored forest is in Lampang Province in Northern Thailand. A [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|previously]] forested site which had been [[20_Vocabulary/degrade|degraded]] through [[20_Vocabulary/mining|mining]] was reforested by a cement [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|together with]] Chiang Mai University. After spreading 60 cm of topsoil, they planted 14 [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] native tree species which included several species of [[20_Vocabulary/fig|fig]]. [[20_Vocabulary/fig|Figs]] are [[20_Vocabulary/a keystone species|a keystone species]] because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations. They are central to tropical reforestation projects as they [[20_Vocabulary/accelerate|accelerate]] the speed of the recovery process by attracting animals [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] birds which [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|act]] as natural [[20_Vocabulary/natural seed disperser|seed dispersers]]. ***Q37***. This helps to [[20_Vocabulary/promote|promote]] [[20_Vocabulary/variety|diversity]] through the healthy regrowth of [[20_Vocabulary/a wide range of|a wide range of]] plant species. [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Unlike]] the majority of fruit trees, [[20_Vocabulary/fig|figs]] bear fruit all year round, providing [[20_Vocabulary/a reliable food source|a reliable food source]] for many species. At this site, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]], after [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] three rainy seasons, monkeys started visiting to eat the [[20_Vocabulary/fig|fig]] fruits, naturally dispersing seeds through [[20_Vocabulary/defecation|defecation]]. ***Q38***

Reforestation projects should always [[20_Vocabulary/objective|aim]] to make [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] that [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] communities are [[20_Vocabulary/consult|consulted]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]] in [[20_Vocabulary/the decision-making process|the decision-making process]].

The restoration of [[20_Vocabulary/mangrove forest|mangrove]] forests in Madagascar is an [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] of a [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] which has succeeded in [[20_Vocabulary/invent|creating]] real benefits for the community. [[20_Vocabulary/ruin|Destruction]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/mangrove forest|mangrove]] forests had a [[20_Vocabulary/awful|terrible]] [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] plant [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] animal [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] badly affected the fishing [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]], which was a major source of employment for [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] people living in coastal areas. ***Q39***. The [[20_Vocabulary/Large-scale reforestation projects|reforestation project]] [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]] hiring [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] people to plant [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/caring|care]] for the new [[20_Vocabulary/mangrove forest|mangrove]] trees. Millions of [[20_Vocabulary/mangrove forest|mangrove]] trees have now been planted which has [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|resulted in]] the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem. The [[20_Vocabulary/mangrove forest|mangroves]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|act]] as a defence against the increased threat of flooding caused by [[20_Vocabulary/carbon emission|climate change]]. What’s more, the [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] economy is more [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|stable]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] thousands more Madagascans are now [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to send their children to school. ***Q40***
