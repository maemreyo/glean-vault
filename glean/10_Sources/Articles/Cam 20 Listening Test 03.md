**MAN** Good morning

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Hi, this is Michelin Meyer. I’m renting your house on Archwood Avenue. I’m [[20_Vocabulary/due to|due to]] move in next week.

**MAN** Oh, yes. Hello, Ms. Meyer. What can I do for you?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] I viewed the house, I told you I’ll most [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] need to rent some [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]], [[20_Vocabulary/at least|at least]] until I know whether my temporary work contract is [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be made [[20_Vocabulary/permanently|permanent]].

**MAN** Yes, of course. I [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] I said I could give you some information [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] rental companies in the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** That’s right.

**MAN** Well, the biggest [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] is called Peak Rentals. I’ve recommended them to other people [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have always heard [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|positive]] reports [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] them.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Could you give me an idea of their costs?

**MAN** [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|Sure]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] have one of their brochures here. It says the monthly [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] per room starts at $105 [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] goes up to $239. That [[20_Vocabulary/depends on|depends on]] which rooms you need [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] for, of course.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|Sure]]. It’s just to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] a general idea of how much it’s [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] cost. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] you said you had some [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|positive]] feedback [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] this [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]]?

**MAN** Yes. People have mentioned that the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] from Peak Rentals is more modern than any of the other companies. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And also]], [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] you place an [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]], the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be delivered to you in just one or two days.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** That [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]].

**MAN** Oh, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the [[20_Vocabulary/brochure|brochure]] says that there’s a special [[20_Vocabulary/propose|offer]] at the moment. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you rent living room [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]], I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|believe]] that’s a [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] of [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|chairs]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] a TV table, you’ll [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] a lamp at no [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] cost.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Okay, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] you know, that [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] [[20_Vocabulary/variety|range]] you gave is more than I was hoping to pay.

**MAN** Then you could [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] Aaron [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Oliver.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/regret|Sorry]], what [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Oliver?

**MAN** Aaron, double A-R-O-N

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** OK, are they cheaper

**MAN** I say they are [[20_Vocabulary/a mid company|a mid company]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you chose them you need to be [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|aware]] that they [[20_Vocabulary/charges|charge]] an [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] 12 every month [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|in case of]] [[20_Vocabulary/harm|damage]]

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Oh, I see. I’d have to do the math carefully then.

**MAN** Right. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] one [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]] thing is that they [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] do cleaning for customers.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** For the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]]?

**MAN** For the house.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Oh, I see. I [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] won’t need that.

*Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 6 to 10.*

**MAN** There’s another [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] called Larch [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|Furniture]]. It’s quite new, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it has the lowest prices in town. That’s for both [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] electronic [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Well, that [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be good. I’m not bringing much with me, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I won’t have much time to go shopping after I start my job.

**MAN** There are two things you need to know [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] large [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]]. [[20_Vocabulary/First of all|First of all]] you have to take out insurance on the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] you need to [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|organize]] that yourself

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** That wouldn’t be [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] hard.

MAN [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|Also]] you can take out a contract for less than six months [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I figure that might not be a problem for you. You’re renting the house for 12 months [[20_Vocabulary/after all|after all]], aren’t you?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yes, okay. Well, I…

MAN [[20_Vocabulary/regret|Sorry]] to interrupt. I just thought of another [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] rental [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]]. It’s called Space Rentals, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it’s located very near to the house.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Okay.

**MAN** I don’t have any information [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] their [[20_Vocabulary/charges|charges]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] it’s best to use their app to find out what it [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] cost you to use them.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Okay, thanks. I’ll do that.

**MAN** One good thing [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] is that [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you don’t [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] it’s delivered, you can request exchanges, as long as you do that within a week of receiving it.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** That sounds [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] great. Okay, well, thanks very much. That’s [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]]

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

Hello, I’m Hayden. I’m one of the archaeologists investigating the site here at Bidcuster. This is the third summer for this [[20_Vocabulary/the community project|community project]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] most of the people digging here are volunteers. I’m a full-time [[20_Vocabulary/archaeologist|archaeologist]] for [[20_Vocabulary/the town council|the town council]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I was asked to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|join]] the [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] by NHA, [[20_Vocabulary/a charity|a charity]] which sets up projects [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] this up [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] down the country. As you can see, we’re next to Bidcaster [[20_Vocabulary/castle|Castle]], which is great because the owners let us use their [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], how did we [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] to where we are today?

Many [[20_Vocabulary/archaeologist|archaeology]] projects [[20_Vocabulary/take place|happen]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] an ancient object is [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] in our case that object was a gold coin. Coins are often [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] by people using [[20_Vocabulary/a metal detector|metal detectors]] to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] for things buried in the ground or coins are uncovered [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] wild animals [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] rabbits have been digging tunnels. Here, a walker [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] it on the ground after a rainstorm washed [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] some of the earth [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sand. [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] the story of the gold coin [[20_Vocabulary/impact|hit]] the news, Peter Swift, [[20_Vocabulary/an amateur historian|an amateur historian]], contacted me to say he believed there had been a village on this site, centuries before the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] was built. Just by [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]], the team [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] some [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] maps [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] documents in our library, which showed 500-year-[[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] drawings of [[20_Vocabulary/ruin|ruined]] buildings on the [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grassy]] area between the outer [[20_Vocabulary/the outer stone wall|stone walls]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the river. We knew then we were onto something. [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|Over]] the three summers the team has been here, we’ve [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] the remains of several buildings, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] more broken pots than you can count. Normally you’d expect to find [[20_Vocabulary/brooches|brooches]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other [[20_Vocabulary/jewellery|jewellery]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we’re still waiting to [[20_Vocabulary/excavate|uncover]] any such [[20_Vocabulary/agenda|items]]. The people who [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] lived here were [[20_Vocabulary/capable|skilled]] at making [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]] from animal bones, as you’ll see [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] you visit the [[20_Vocabulary/exhibition|exhibition]]. [[20_Vocabulary/beside|Besides]] the [[20_Vocabulary/a real eye-opener|discovery]] of the village, we’ve [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] of human activity on the other side of the river. No other houses or [[20_Vocabulary/huts|huts]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] far, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we can see the borders of an ancient [[20_Vocabulary/non-forested landscape|field]] system. At one point we [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] a long wall [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] thought it was an ancient [[20_Vocabulary/castle|palace]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it [[20_Vocabulary/turned out|turned out]] to be a modern wall. This summer’s work [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] end soon, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we’ll be back next summer. [[20_Vocabulary/In the meantime|In the meantime]], we’re putting on a series of guided tours for school groups this autumn. Oh, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] you saw [[20_Vocabulary/the TV documentary|the TV documentary]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] our [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]]. That suggests the objects we’ve [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] are [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] the town’s museum, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we don’t know that for [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] yet.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the talk you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 17 to 20 Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer* *questions 17 to 20.*

[[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] you [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|enter]] the site, please make [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you [[20_Vocabulary/castle|keep]] to the paths at all times. There are a few other things, the highlights of the site [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]], that I want to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]]. Take a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the map. Our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|present]] [[20_Vocabulary/placement|location]] is [[20_Vocabulary/mark|marked]] at the bottom. This year, we’ve [[20_Vocabulary/identify|identified]] the foundations of an ancient bridge, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] exciting today because a team of divers are in the river searching for [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] objects. To [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|reach]] the bridge, take the [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|main]] path ahead of you, go straight on, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/castle|keep]] going till the path [[20_Vocabulary/bends to the left|bends to the left]]. You’ll see [[20_Vocabulary/a smaller track leading off to the right|a smaller track leading off to the right]]. [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|Follow]] that to take you to the river, where the divers are. You might be [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested]] to see [[20_Vocabulary/the rubbish pit|the rubbish pit]]. This is very near the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] walls in the north-west corner of the site. It [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] dates to the time of the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] not the ancient village. We [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] [[20_Vocabulary/oyster shells|oyster shells]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] fish bones, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we [[20_Vocabulary/undertaken on|assumed]] they were thrown from the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] [[20_Vocabulary/apron|kitchen]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|above]]. One area we [[20_Vocabulary/excavate|excavated]] in the first summer uncovered the site of a [[20_Vocabulary/conference|meeting]] [[20_Vocabulary/hall|hall]]. We knew it was an [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] building because it had [[20_Vocabulary/two rows of post holes|two rows of post holes]], deep enough to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] a large roof. It is the largest structure in the central area of the site next to the current [[20_Vocabulary/excavate|excavation]] area. [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|Last]] year we discovered a fish pond in the ancient village. Normally these were [[20_Vocabulary/beside|beside]] a river. The pond here is further [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] the river has moved [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|slightly]]. Anyway, to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] there from here, you [[20_Vocabulary/curve|turn]] right at the first information board you [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] to [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|follow]] the path into the trees. Before you [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] the trees, you’ll see it on your right. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|reach]] the river, you’ve gone [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] far. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], does anyone have…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

**MAYA** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], Finn, I’ve done as much as I can for our [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] on theatre programmes. How’s your [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] coming along?

**FINN** OK, Maya. I didn’t know theatre programmes are called [[20_Vocabulary/playbills|playbills]] in the USA till I started looking into the topic. [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|Even]] [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] I struggled to find many [[20_Vocabulary/informative|useful]] websites, I’m glad we picked this subject. No one else on the course is doing the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] as us, [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] it is one of the [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] areas of [[20_Vocabulary/the module convener|the module convener]].

**MAYA** That might [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] put some people off.

**FINN** I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|suppose so]]. Anyway I hadn’t realised there are [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] companies specialising in [[20_Vocabulary/invent|creating]] theatre programmes

**MAYA** Yes they are quite [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|common]] nowadays. [[20_Vocabulary/Contrary|Contrary]] to what many people [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], theatres don’t [[20_Vocabulary/recruit|hire]] people to do the programmes. [[20_Vocabulary/actually|In fact]], companies buy the rights to publish programmes on [[20_Vocabulary/the theatre’s behalf|the theatre’s behalf]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then make their money selling [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|advertising]] space within [[20_Vocabulary/the programme booklet|the programme booklet]].

**FINN** It must be easier for theatres to do it that way.

**MAYA** Yes.

**FINN** I [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] reading something [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] programmes in early British theatre. It said that [[20_Vocabulary/the cast|the cast]] was always very [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]].

**MAYA** Yeah, audiences were very familiar with leading actors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] big names [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/draw huge crowds|draw huge crowds]].

**FINN** [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I hadn’t realised that [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the programme named a [[20_Vocabulary/well known|famous]] actor, that’s who the [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] expected to [[20_Vocabulary/carry out|perform]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] that didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/take place|happen]], people accused the theatre of breaking their agreement with the [[20_Vocabulary/audience|audience]]. They [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] demand refunds [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] them, there were riots.

**MAYA** [[20_Vocabulary/outrageous|Outrageous]]! That’d never [[20_Vocabulary/take place|happen]] now.

**FINN** No, people are [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] [[20_Vocabulary/polite|polite]], [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] they’re [[20_Vocabulary/frustration|disappointed]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the star of the [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] misses a [[20_Vocabulary/concert|performance]].

**MAYA** We [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] that information [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] early audiences in our [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]] that lots of [[20_Vocabulary/average|ordinary]] people at that time were [[20_Vocabulary/illiterate|illiterate]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] theatre programmes were of limited [[20_Vocabulary/worth|value]] in [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|advertising]] plays. [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] a [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] of actors arrived in a town, they’d [[20_Vocabulary/parade|parade]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the streets in their costumes, beating drums [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] announcing their [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|upcoming]] performances.

**FINN** Interesting. I couldn’t [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|imagine]] that happening now either.

**MAYA** There’s [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/an interesting comparison|an interesting comparison]] to make between 18th [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] 19th century programmes.

**FINN** Wasn’t it in the 19th century that theatre programmes started to [[20_Vocabulary/resemble|resemble]] programs today

**MAYA** Yes [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|unlike]] programs from the 18th century they always [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] colour

**FINN** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] there was a greater [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]] of designs. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] personally I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] 18th century programmes were [[20_Vocabulary/superior|superior]] because they told the theatregoers [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] many things, including [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the actors.

**MAYA** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the writer, the plot [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sometimes the history of the play.

**FINN** That’s right. What [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] we say [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] theatre programmes in the 20th century?

**MAYA** I [[20_Vocabulary/reckon|reckon]] the most [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] thing is [[20_Vocabulary/the dramatic change|the dramatic change]] they [[20_Vocabulary/undergone|underwent]] during World War II.

**FINN** [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] the government imposed restrictions on the use of paper.

**MAYA** Yeah, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that was [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] in the UK. In the USA, programmes, or [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] [[20_Vocabulary/playbills|playbills]], continued to be published in the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] format.

**FINN** [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|While]] here in the UK, programmes became [[20_Vocabulary/merely|merely]] a [[20_Vocabulary/sole|single]] sheet of paper folded to [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] four pages for text.

**MAYA** What I don’t [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] is that after the war they didn’t go back to [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] more than one sheet or [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] in any way for [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] 25 years. I know there were paper shortages after the war, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] for five or ten years.

**FINN** Strange.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discussion]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 27 to 30. Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]]* *answer questions 27 to 30.*

**MAYA** I got some pictures of programmes we could [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] on the slides for our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]].

**FINN** I [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] a couple [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] Maya. Let [[20_Vocabulary/go through|go through]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] see what we [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]]

**MAYA** Um oh this is an [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] one for a play called Ruey Blass

**FINN** Never heard of that. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] the programme [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] very [[20_Vocabulary/decorative|decorative]].

**MAYA** Good enough to put in a frame on the wall. The images are just [[20_Vocabulary/attractively|beautiful]]. Finn, what did you find?

**FINN** I’ve got some pages from a programme for Man of La Mancha. I thought this was a good programme to [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]], not [[20_Vocabulary/due to|because of]] the pictures, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] because it contains articles written by members of the theatre [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] we can learn how the [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|production]] was [[20_Vocabulary/coined|created]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the thoughts [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feelings]] of [[20_Vocabulary/the cast|the cast]].

**MAYA** Good. I’ve got a copy of a programme that’s now in a museum. It’s for The [[20_Vocabulary/Tragedy|Tragedy]] of Jane Shore [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it’s said to be the earliest [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|surviving]] document to have been printed on Australia’s first printing [[20_Vocabulary/press|press]]

**FINN** Fantastic!

**MAYA** Another programme to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] is for The Sailors Festival. It comes from [[20_Vocabulary/the British Library’s digitised collection of programmes|the British Library’s digitised collection of programmes]] that was started a few years ago. It already [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|comprises]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] 200,000 programmes which is amazing!

**FINN** Huh. Wish I’d known [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] I was doing my [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]].

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

It’s [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] recently that designers have become [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|aware]] of the need to be inclusive [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] [[20_Vocabulary/invent|designing]] [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] what does that [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]]? Well, it simply means [[20_Vocabulary/invent|designing]] [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] that [[20_Vocabulary/span economic|span economic]], social [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] cultural barriers. It means making [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] are accessible, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] that as many [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] types of people as [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] can use them, [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] any [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]] of [[20_Vocabulary/adaptation|adaptation]] having to be made to the original [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|design]]. [[20_Vocabulary/inclusive design|Inclusive design]] is often linked with [[20_Vocabulary/universal design|universal design]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] they are not quite the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] thing. [[20_Vocabulary/universal design|Universal design]] aims to make [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] that [[20_Vocabulary/serve|work for]] everyone [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that includes considering the needs of people who [[20_Vocabulary/have cognitive difficulties|have cognitive difficulties]], which can [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|present]] quite a challenge. Today examples of [[20_Vocabulary/effective|successful]] [[20_Vocabulary/inclusive design|inclusive design]] can be seen all [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] us. In workplaces it is [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|common]] to see desks which can be adjusted to suit people of [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] heights or for [[20_Vocabulary/wheelchair|wheelchair]] users This still isn’t always the case, [[20_Vocabulary/However|however]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] is one reason why office workers often [[20_Vocabulary/suffer from|suffer from]] back or neck problems. You’ll find another [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] toilets of countless hotels, airports [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] offices. Taps that you [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|activate]] by sensor require no [[20_Vocabulary/press|pressing]] or [[20_Vocabulary/twisting movements|twisting movements]]. These are not [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] more [[20_Vocabulary/hygienic|hygienic]], they’re [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] easier for people with dexterity or mobility issues. The tech [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]] has been criticised [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|in the past]] for focusing [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] much on young consumers, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this is changing. Many [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] are now [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] with the [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|elderly]] in mind. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For example]], it’s [[20_Vocabulary/well known|well known]] that [[20_Vocabulary/vision|vision]] declines with age [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that we [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] become worse at [[20_Vocabulary/distinguishing|distinguishing]] between similar colours, [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|in particular]] [[20_Vocabulary/shade|shades]] of blue, which is why software designers rarely [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] interfaces with this colour. Motor skills [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/reject|decline]] with age [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] some people have difficulty doing everyday things [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/strumming|picking]] up a cup or [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opening]] a [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|door]]. This can [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] their [[20_Vocabulary/capable|ability]] to use a mouse or keyboard. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] [[20_Vocabulary/voice access|voice access]] is now a [[20_Vocabulary/regularly|routine]] way of making [[20_Vocabulary/command|commands]]. It’s [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] looking at the problems non-inclusive designs [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|cause]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] not enough [[20_Vocabulary/aspects of caring|consideration]] is given to a [[20_Vocabulary/variety|range]] of users, as it can have a serious [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] people’s lives. [[20_Vocabulary/access|Access]] is one [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obvious]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|example]] because it has such a [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] [[20_Vocabulary/a disability|disabled]] people’s [[20_Vocabulary/independence|independence]]. Not [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/access|access]] [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] transport because buses or trains are not [[20_Vocabulary/wheelchair|wheelchair]] means many [[20_Vocabulary/a disability|disabled]] people can go out unless someone goes with them. Safety is another issue. [[20_Vocabulary/Inexplicably|Inexplicably]], most cars are still [[20_Vocabulary/crash-tested|crash-tested]] using a dummy based on an [[20_Vocabulary/average-sized male|average-sized male]]. This has safety [[20_Vocabulary/implication|implications]] for all [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]], [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] those who are [[20_Vocabulary/pregnant|pregnant]], as the seatbelts [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] by the dummy are not adapted to [[20_Vocabulary/accommodate|accommodate]] them. [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|Over]] the [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|past]] 100 years, workplaces in the UK have, [[20_Vocabulary/on the whole|on the whole]], become [[20_Vocabulary/considerably|considerably]] safer. Employers are [[20_Vocabulary/legally|legally]] required to provide well-maintained [[20_Vocabulary/PPE jacket|personal protective equipment]], or [[20_Vocabulary/PPE jacket|PPE]], anything from [[20_Vocabulary/goggles|goggles]] to full bodysuits, to workers who need it, [[20_Vocabulary/free of charge|free of charge]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] most [[20_Vocabulary/PPE jacket|PPE]] is [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to fit men. A recent report [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that employers often [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] that [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] it comes to [[20_Vocabulary/female|female]] workers, all they need to do to [[20_Vocabulary/comply|comply]] with this legal requirement is to buy jackets, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]], [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] for a [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]] man. The problem with this is that [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]] can be tall [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] still have much smaller shoulders than the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] man. Ill-fitting [[20_Vocabulary/PPE jacket|PPE]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] high-vis jackets, vests [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|body]] armour can put [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]] [[20_Vocabulary/at risk of drying out|at risk]]. The report [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that 95% of [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]] said that their [[20_Vocabulary/PPE jacket|PPE]] often [[20_Vocabulary/hampered|hampered]] their work [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that this problem was worst in [[20_Vocabulary/the emergency services|the emergency services]]. [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] the police. Another problem is [[20_Vocabulary/associate|related to]] [[20_Vocabulary/Comfort|comfort]] at work. A very [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|common]] scenario in offices in summertime is to see [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]] wrapped in blankets or wearing sweaters [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] the air conditioning is on high. [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|Meanwhile]], the men are in shorts [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] T-shirts. This is [[20_Vocabulary/due to|due to]] differences in [[20_Vocabulary/metabolism|metabolic]] rates for men [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]]. There is a [[20_Vocabulary/average|standard]] [[20_Vocabulary/background|setting]] for air conditioning to be at a temperature of 21 degrees [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to suit men [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] in most modern offices it is not [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] to [[20_Vocabulary/curve|turn]] the air conditioning up or down. This means that many offices which [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] employ [[20_Vocabulary/female|women]] are wasting energy by having the air conditioning [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] high. As you can see from the examples I’ve just mentioned, there are serious consequences for designs which don’t [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|consider]] the needs of all users.
