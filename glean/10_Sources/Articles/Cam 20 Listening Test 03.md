### PART 1

**MAN** Good morning

**WOMAN** Hi, this is Michelin Meyer. I'm renting your house on Archwood Avenue. I'm [[20_Vocabulary/due to|due to]] move in next week.

**MAN** Oh, yes. Hello, Ms. Meyer. What can I do for you?

**WOMAN** When I viewed the house, I told you I'll most [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] need to rent some [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]], [[20_Vocabulary/at least|at least]] until I know whether my temporary work contract is going to be made permanent.

**MAN** Yes, of course. I remember. And I said I could give you some information about [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] rental companies in the city.

**WOMAN** That's right.

**MAN** Well, the biggest company is called Peak Rentals. I've recommended them to other people and have always heard positive reports about them.

**WOMAN** Could you give me an idea of their costs?

**MAN** Sure. I [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] have one of their brochures here. It says the monthly price per room starts at $105 and goes up to $239. That [[20_Vocabulary/depends on|depends on]] which rooms you need [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] for, of course.

**WOMAN** Sure. It's just to get a general idea of how much it's going to cost. And you said you had some positive feedback about this company?

**MAN** Yes. People have mentioned that the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] from Peak Rentals is more modern than any of the other companies. And also, once you place an order, the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be delivered to you in just one or two days.

**WOMAN** That would be really helpful.

**MAN** Oh, and the [[20_Vocabulary/brochure|brochure]] says that there's a special offer at the moment. If you rent living room [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]], I believe that's a set of chairs and a TV table, you'll also get a lamp at no extra cost.

**WOMAN** Okay, but you know, that price range you gave is more than I was hoping to pay.

**MAN** Then you could try Aaron and Oliver.

**WOMAN** Sorry, what and Oliver?

**MAN** Aaron, double A-R-O-N

**WOMAN** OK, are they cheaper

**MAN** I say they are [[20_Vocabulary/a mid company|a mid company]] But if you chose them you need to be aware that they charge an extra 12 every month [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|in case of]] damage

**WOMAN** Oh, I see. I'd have to do the math carefully then.

**MAN** Right. But one helpful thing is that they also do cleaning for customers.

**WOMAN** For the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]]?

**MAN** For the house.

**WOMAN** Oh, I see. I [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] won't need that.

*Now listen and answer questions 6 to 10.*

**MAN** There's another company called Larch [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|Furniture]]. It's quite new, and it has the lowest prices in town. That's for both [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] and also electronic [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]].

**WOMAN** Well, that would be good. I'm not bringing much with me, and I won't have much time to go shopping after I start my job.

**MAN** There are two things you need to know about large [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]]. [[20_Vocabulary/First of all|First of all]] you have to take out insurance on the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] and you need to organize that yourself

**WOMAN** That wouldn't be too hard.

MAN Also you can take out a contract for less than six months but I figure that might not be a problem for you. You're renting the house for 12 months [[20_Vocabulary/after all|after all]], aren't you?

**WOMAN** Yes, okay. Well, I…

MAN Sorry to interrupt. I just thought of another [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] rental company. It's called Space Rentals, and it's located very near to the house.

**WOMAN** Okay.

**MAN** I don't have any information about their [[20_Vocabulary/charges|charges]], so it's best to use their app to find out what it would cost you to use them.

**WOMAN** Okay, thanks. I'll do that.

**MAN** One good thing about that company is that if you don't like the [[20_Vocabulary/furniture|furniture]] once it's delivered, you can request exchanges, as long as you do that within a week of receiving it.

**WOMAN** That sounds really great. Okay, well, thanks very much. That's so helpful

### PART 2

Hello, I'm Hayden. I'm one of the archaeologists investigating the site here at Bidcuster. This is the third summer for this community project, and most of the people digging here are volunteers. I'm a full-time [[20_Vocabulary/archaeologist|archaeologist]] for [[20_Vocabulary/the town council|the town council]], but I was asked to join the project by NHA, [[20_Vocabulary/a charity|a charity]] which sets up projects like this up and down the country. As you can see, we're next to Bidcaster [[20_Vocabulary/castle|Castle]], which is great because the owners let us use their [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]]. So, how did we get to where we are today?

Many archaeology projects happen when an ancient object is found, and in our case that object was a gold coin. Coins are often found by people using metal detectors to look for things buried in the ground or coins are uncovered when wild animals like rabbits have been digging tunnels. Here, a walker found it on the ground after a rainstorm washed away some of the earth and sand. When the story of the gold coin hit the news, Peter Swift, [[20_Vocabulary/an amateur historian|an amateur historian]], contacted me to say he believed there had been a village on this site, centuries before the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] was built. Just by chance, the team found some old maps and documents in our library, which showed 500-year-old drawings of ruined buildings on the grassy area between the outer stone walls of the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] and the river. We knew then we were onto something. Over the three summers the team has been here, we've found the remains of several buildings, and more broken pots than you can count. Normally you'd expect to find [[20_Vocabulary/brooches|brooches]] and other [[20_Vocabulary/jewellery|jewellery]], but we're still waiting to uncover any such items. The people who once lived here were skilled at making tools from animal bones, as you'll see when you visit the [[20_Vocabulary/exhibition|exhibition]]. Besides the discovery of the village, we've also found evidence of human activity on the other side of the river. No other houses or [[20_Vocabulary/huts|huts]] so far, but we can see the borders of an ancient field system. At one point we found a long wall and thought it was an ancient palace, but it [[20_Vocabulary/turned out|turned out]] to be a modern wall. This summer's work [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] end soon, but we'll be back next summer. [[20_Vocabulary/In the meantime|In the meantime]], we're putting on a series of guided tours for school groups this autumn. Oh, and maybe you saw [[20_Vocabulary/the TV documentary|the TV documentary]] about our project. That suggests the objects we've found are going to the town's museum, but we don't know that for sure [[20_Vocabulary/yet|yet]].

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the talk you have some time to look at questions 17 to 20 Now listen and answer* *questions 17 to 20.*

When you enter the site, please make sure you keep to the paths at all times. There are a few other things, the highlights of the site if you like, that I want to mention. Take a look at the map. Our present location is marked at the bottom. This year, we've identified the foundations of an ancient bridge, and it's really exciting today because a team of divers are in the river searching for lost objects. To reach the bridge, take the main path ahead of you, go straight on, and keep going till the path [[20_Vocabulary/bends to the left|bends to the left]]. You'll see [[20_Vocabulary/a smaller track leading off to the right|a smaller track leading off to the right]]. Follow that to take you to the river, where the divers are. You might be interested to see [[20_Vocabulary/the rubbish pit|the rubbish pit]]. This is very near the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] walls in the north-west corner of the site. It [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] dates to the time of the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] and not the ancient village. We found [[20_Vocabulary/oyster shells|oyster shells]] and fish bones, and we assumed they were thrown from the [[20_Vocabulary/castle|castle]] kitchen above. One area we excavated in the first summer uncovered the site of a meeting [[20_Vocabulary/hall|hall]]. We knew it was an important building because it had [[20_Vocabulary/two rows of post holes|two rows of post holes]], deep enough to support a large roof. It is the largest structure in the central area of the site next to the current excavation area. Last year we discovered a fish pond in the ancient village. Normally these were [[20_Vocabulary/beside|beside]] a river. The pond here is further away, but it's possible the river has moved [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|slightly]]. Anyway, to get there from here, you turn right at the first information board you come to and follow the path into the trees. Before you come out of the trees, you'll see it on your right. If you reach the river, you've gone too far. So, does anyone have…

### PART 3

**MAYA** So, Finn, I've done as much as I can for our project on theatre programmes. How's your research coming along?

**FINN** OK, Maya. I didn't know theatre programmes are called [[20_Vocabulary/playbills|playbills]] in the USA till I started looking into the topic. Even though I struggled to find many useful websites, I'm glad we picked this subject. No one else on the course is doing the same as us, although it is one of the research areas of [[20_Vocabulary/the module convener|the module convener]].

**MAYA** That might [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] put some people off.

**FINN** I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|suppose so]]. Anyway I hadn't realised there are [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] companies specialising in creating theatre programmes

**MAYA** Yes they are quite common nowadays. [[20_Vocabulary/Contrary|Contrary]] to what many people think, theatres don't hire people to do the programmes. In fact, companies buy the rights to publish programmes on [[20_Vocabulary/the theatre's behalf|the theatre's behalf]] and then make their money selling advertising space within [[20_Vocabulary/the programme booklet|the programme booklet]].

**FINN** It must be easier for theatres to do it that way.

**MAYA** Yes.

**FINN** I remember reading something about programmes in early British theatre. It said that [[20_Vocabulary/the cast|the cast]] was always very important.

**MAYA** Yeah, audiences were very familiar with leading actors and big names would [[20_Vocabulary/draw huge crowds|draw huge crowds]].

**FINN** But I hadn't realised that if the programme named a famous actor, that's who the public expected to perform. And if that didn't happen, people accused the theatre of breaking their [[20_Vocabulary/agreement|agreement]] with the [[20_Vocabulary/audience|audience]]. They would demand refunds and if they didn't get them, there were riots.

**MAYA** [[20_Vocabulary/outrageous|Outrageous]]! That'd never happen now.

**FINN** No, people are too [[20_Vocabulary/polite|polite]], even when they're disappointed if the star of the show misses a performance.

**MAYA** We should definitely include that information about early audiences in our project. I also think it's important to mention that lots of ordinary people at that time were [[20_Vocabulary/illiterate|illiterate]], so theatre programmes were of limited value in advertising plays. When a company of actors arrived in a town, they'd [[20_Vocabulary/parade|parade]] around the streets in their costumes, beating drums and announcing their upcoming performances.

**FINN** Interesting. I couldn't imagine that happening now either.

**MAYA** There's also [[20_Vocabulary/an interesting comparison|an interesting comparison]] to make between 18th and 19th century programmes.

**FINN** Wasn't it in the 19th century that theatre programmes started to [[20_Vocabulary/resemble|resemble]] programs today

**MAYA** Yes and unlike programs from the 18th century they always used colour

**FINN** And there was a greater [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]] of designs. But [[20_Vocabulary/Personally|personally]] I think 18th century programmes were [[20_Vocabulary/superior|superior]] because they told the theatregoers so many things, including about the actors.

**MAYA** And about the writer, the plot and sometimes the history of the play.

**FINN** That's right. What should we say about theatre programmes in the 20th century?

**MAYA** I [[20_Vocabulary/reckon|reckon]] the most important thing is [[20_Vocabulary/the dramatic change|the dramatic change]] they underwent during World War II.

**FINN** When the government imposed restrictions on the use of paper.

**MAYA** Yeah, but that was only in the UK. In the USA, programmes, or rather [[20_Vocabulary/playbills|playbills]], continued to be published in the same format.

**FINN** While here in the UK, programmes became [[20_Vocabulary/merely|merely]] a single sheet of paper folded to create four pages for text.

**MAYA** What I don't really get is that after the war they didn't go back to being more than one sheet or change in any way for over 25 years. I know there were paper shortages after the war, but only for five or ten years.

**FINN** Strange.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 27 to 30. Now listen and* *answer questions 27 to 30.*

**MAYA** I got some pictures of programmes we could include on the slides for our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]].

**FINN** I found a couple too Maya. Let [[20_Vocabulary/go through|go through]] and see what we think

**MAYA** Um oh this is an old one for a play called Ruey Blass

**FINN** Never heard of that. But the programme looks very [[20_Vocabulary/decorative|decorative]].

**MAYA** Good enough to put in a frame on the wall. The images are just beautiful. Finn, what did you find?

**FINN** I've got some pages from a programme for Man of La Mancha. I thought this was a good programme to show, not because of the pictures, but because it contains articles written by members of the theatre company, so we can learn how the production was created and the thoughts and feelings of [[20_Vocabulary/the cast|the cast]].

**MAYA** Good. I've got a copy of a programme that's now in a museum. It's for The [[20_Vocabulary/Tragedy|Tragedy]] of Jane Shore and it's said to be the earliest surviving document to have been printed on Australia's first printing [[20_Vocabulary/press|press]]

**FINN** Fantastic!

**MAYA** Another programme to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] is for The Sailors Festival. It comes from the British Library's digitised collection of programmes that was started a few years ago. It already comprises over 200,000 programmes which is amazing!

**FINN** Huh. Wish I'd known about it while I was doing my research.

### PART 4

It's only [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] recently that designers have become aware of the need to be inclusive when designing products. But what does that mean exactly? Well, it simply means designing products that [[20_Vocabulary/span economic|span economic]], social and cultural barriers. It means making sure products are accessible, [[20_Vocabulary/so that|so that]] as many different types of people as possible can use them, without any type of [[20_Vocabulary/adaptation|adaptation]] having to be made to the original design. [[20_Vocabulary/inclusive design|Inclusive design]] is often linked with [[20_Vocabulary/universal design|universal design]], although they are not quite the same thing. [[20_Vocabulary/universal design|Universal design]] aims to make products that work for everyone and that includes considering the needs of people who [[20_Vocabulary/have cognitive difficulties|have cognitive difficulties]], which can present quite a challenge. Today examples of successful [[20_Vocabulary/inclusive design|inclusive design]] can be seen all around us. In workplaces it is common to see desks which can be adjusted to suit people of different heights or for [[20_Vocabulary/wheelchair|wheelchair]] users This still isn't always the case, [[20_Vocabulary/However|however]], and is one reason why office workers often [[20_Vocabulary/suffer from|suffer from]] back or neck problems. You'll find another example in the public toilets of countless hotels, airports and offices. Taps that you activate by sensor require no pressing or [[20_Vocabulary/twisting movements|twisting movements]]. These are not only more [[20_Vocabulary/hygienic|hygienic]], they're also easier for people with dexterity or mobility issues. The tech industry has been criticised in the past for focusing too much on young consumers, but this is changing. Many products are now designed with the [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|elderly]] in mind. For example, it's [[20_Vocabulary/well known|well known]] that [[20_Vocabulary/vision|vision]] declines with age and that we also become worse at [[20_Vocabulary/distinguishing|distinguishing]] between similar colours, in particular shades of blue, which is why software designers rarely create interfaces with this colour. Motor skills also decline with age and some people have difficulty doing everyday things like picking up a cup or opening a door. This can also [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] their ability to use a mouse or keyboard. So [[20_Vocabulary/voice access|voice access]] is now a routine way of making commands. It's [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] looking at the problems non-inclusive designs cause when not enough consideration is given to a range of users, as it can have a serious [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] on people's lives. [[20_Vocabulary/access|Access]] is one obvious example because it has such a huge [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] on disabled people's [[20_Vocabulary/independence|independence]]. Not being able to [[20_Vocabulary/access|access]] public transport because buses or trains are not [[20_Vocabulary/wheelchair|wheelchair]] means many disabled people can go out unless someone goes with them. Safety is another issue. [[20_Vocabulary/Inexplicably|Inexplicably]], most cars are still [[20_Vocabulary/crash-tested|crash-tested]] using a dummy based on an [[20_Vocabulary/average-sized male|average-sized male]]. This has safety implications for all women, [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] those who are [[20_Vocabulary/pregnant|pregnant]], as the seatbelts [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] by the dummy are not adapted to [[20_Vocabulary/accommodate|accommodate]] them. Over the past 100 years, workplaces in the UK have, [[20_Vocabulary/on the whole|on the whole]], become [[20_Vocabulary/considerably|considerably]] safer. Employers are [[20_Vocabulary/legally|legally]] required to provide well-maintained personal protective [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]], or PPE, anything from [[20_Vocabulary/goggles|goggles]] to full bodysuits, to workers who need it, [[20_Vocabulary/free of charge|free of charge]]. But most PPE is designed to fit men. A recent report found that employers often think that when it comes to [[20_Vocabulary/female|female]] workers, all they need to do to [[20_Vocabulary/comply|comply]] with this legal requirement is to buy jackets, for example, designed for a small man. The problem with this is that women can be tall and still have much smaller shoulders than the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] man. Ill-fitting PPE such as high-vis jackets, vests and body armour can put women at risk. The report found that 95% of women said that their PPE often [[20_Vocabulary/hampered|hampered]] their work and that this problem was worst in [[20_Vocabulary/the emergency services|the emergency services]]. [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] the police. Another problem is related to [[20_Vocabulary/Comfort|comfort]] at work. A very common scenario in offices in summertime is to see women wrapped in blankets or wearing sweaters while the air conditioning is on high. Meanwhile, the men are in shorts and T-shirts. This is [[20_Vocabulary/due to|due to]] differences in metabolic rates for men and women. There is a standard setting for air conditioning to be at a temperature of 21 degrees designed to suit men and in most modern offices it is not possible to turn the air conditioning up or down. This means that many offices which [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] employ women are wasting energy by having the air conditioning set too high. As you can see from the examples I've just mentioned, there are serious consequences for designs which don't consider the needs of all users.
