Reindeer (or caribou) have to live through <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolonged season</mark>s of darkness during Arctic winters (it stays darker longer), so God provided them with the ability to change their whole eye color. Their eyes turn blue, increasing their <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">visual sensitivity</mark> by up to 1,000 times, allowing them to detect predators in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">low-light condition</mark>s.

In summer, their eyes shift back to gold to handle <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the glare of endless daylight</mark>. We can clearly see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">God's provision and planning</mark>!
