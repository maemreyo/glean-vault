Reindeer (or caribou) have to live through prolonged seasons of darkness during Arctic winters (it stays darker longer), so God provided them with the ability to change their whole eye color. Their eyes turn blue, increasing their visual sensitivity by up to 1,000 times, allowing them to detect predators in low-light conditions.

In summer, their eyes shift back to gold to handle the glare of endless daylight. We can clearly see God's provision and planning!
