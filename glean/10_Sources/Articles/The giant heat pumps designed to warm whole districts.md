## Meet the biggest heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] in the world

MVV Energie is building the world's most [[20_Vocabulary/effective|powerful]] heat pump systems

The pipe that [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] supply the heat pump, [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|drawing]] water from the River Rhine in Germany, is [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] big that you could walk through it, fully upright, I'm told.

"We [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|plan]] to take 10,000 litres per second," says Felix Hack, project [[20_Vocabulary/supervisor|manager]] at MVV [[20_Vocabulary/background|Environment]], an energy [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]], as he describes the 2m diameter pipes that [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] suck up river water in Mannheim, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then return it [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] heat from the water has been harvested.

In October, parent [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|firm]] MVV Energie announced its [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|plan]] to [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] what could be the most [[20_Vocabulary/effective|powerful]] heat pump modules ever. Two units, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts.

That's enough to supply [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] 40,000 homes, in total, via a district heating system. MVV Energie aims to [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] the system on the site of a coal power plant that is [[20_Vocabulary/convert|converting]] to cleaner technologies.

The scale of the heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] was determined partly by limits on the size of machinery that could be transported through the streets of Mannheim, or [[20_Vocabulary/potentially|potentially]] via barges along the Rhine. "We're not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that yet," says Mr Hack. "It might come via the river."

One person well [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|aware]] of the project is Alexandre de Rougemont, at Everllence ([[20_Vocabulary/no longer|formerly]] MAN Energy Solutions), another German [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] that [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] makes [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|extremely]] large heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]]. "It is a competition, yeah," he says. "We're open [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it."

Heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] soak up heat from the air, ground or, in these cases, bodies of water. Refrigerants inside the heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] evaporate when they are warmed [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] slightly.

By compressing the refrigerant, you [[20_Vocabulary/promote|boost]] that heat further. This [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] process occurs in heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]] to supply [[20_Vocabulary/sole|single]] homes, it just happens on a much larger scale in giant heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] that [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serve]] entire [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] districts.

As towns [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] cities [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the world [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|seek]] to decarbonise, many are deciding to purchase large heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]], which can attach to district heating networks.

These networks allow hot water or steam to [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|reach]] multiple buildings, all connected up with many kilometres of pipe. Ever bigger models of heat pump are emerging to meet demand.

"There was a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/press|pressure]] on us to [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] the heat generation to new sources, [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|especially]] renewable sources," explains Mr Hack as he discusses the decommissioning of coal-fired units at the Mannheim plant. The site is right by the Rhine, already has a hefty electricity grid [[20_Vocabulary/associate|connection]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] is plugged in to the district heating network, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/make sense|it makes sense]] to install the heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] here, he says.

He notes that the technology is [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] partly thanks to the availability of very large compressors in the oil [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/a fluid|gas]] [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]] – where they are [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to [[20_Vocabulary/press so hard|compress]] [[20_Vocabulary/mass extinction|fossil]] fuels for storage or transportation, for example.

The new heat pump at Mannheim [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] transfer heat from the Rhine

Work on the Mannheim project is due to start next year. The heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] – with a combined capacity of 162MW – are [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] to become fully operational in the winter of 2028-29. Mr Hack adds that a multi-step [[20_Vocabulary/cigarette|filter]] system [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|prevent]] the heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] sucking up fish from the river, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that modelling suggests the system [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|affect]] the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] temperature of the river by less than 0.1C.

[[20_Vocabulary/facilities|Installations]] such as this are not cheap. The Mannheim heat pump [[20_Vocabulary/establish|setup]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] cost €200m ($235m; £176m). Mr de Rougemont at Everllence says that, at his [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]], heat-pump [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]] costs [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|roughly]] €500,000 per megawatt of installed capacity – this does not [[20_Vocabulary/include|include]] the additional cost of buildings, [[20_Vocabulary/associate|associated]] [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|infrastructure]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] on.

Everllence has plans for heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] bigger than this one in Esberg

Everllence is currently [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] on a project in Aalborg, Denmark that [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] more [[20_Vocabulary/effective|powerful]] than the system in Mannheim, with a total capacity of 176MW. It [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] use smaller modules, [[20_Vocabulary/However|however]] – four 44MW units – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] is due to become operational in 2027, when it [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] supply [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|nearly]] one third of all heating demand in the town.

Those 44MW machines are [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] ones [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] in a previous project, now fully operational, to the south of Aalborg in Esbjerg. There, they don't run at maximum capacity [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] rather supply 35MW each.

Large hot water storage tanks, each [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|hold]] 200,000 cubic metres of [[20_Vocabulary/a fluid|liquid]], [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] give the system added [[20_Vocabulary/flexibility|flexibility]], adds Mr de Rougemont: "When the electricity [[20_Vocabulary/worth|price]] is high, you [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|stop]] your heat pump [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] provide heat from the storage."

Veronika Wilk at the Austrian [[20_Vocabulary/establish|Institute]] of Technology says, "Heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] district heating systems are a great fit." Such systems can harvest heat from bodies of water or [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/sewage|wastewater]] from [[20_Vocabulary/sewage|sewage treatment]] plants.

Dr Wilk notes that, when you use multiple large heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] on a district heating network, you [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|gain]] [[20_Vocabulary/flexibility|flexibility]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] efficiency. You could run two [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] four heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] in the autumn, say, when less heat is required than during the depths of winter.

Helsinki is overhauling its district heating system

All the systems mentioned [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] far harvest energy from water sources [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]], less commonly, very large heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] can use the air as a heat source, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|Even]] in a [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] cold [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] such as Helsinki.

"The sea in front of Helsinki is [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] shallow," explains Timo Aaltonen, [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|senior]] vice president of heating [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] cooling at Helen Oy, an energy [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|firm]]. "We calculated that we [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] need to [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] a tunnel more than 20km long to the ocean, to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] enough water \[with a\] temperature high enough."

Helsinki is in the process of radically overhauling its district heating system. The [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] has added heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]], biomass burners [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] electric boilers to a 1,400km network that links up [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|nearly]] 90% of buildings in the Finnish [[20_Vocabulary/major city|capital]], adds Mr Aaltonen.

Heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/convert|convert]] [[20_Vocabulary/sole|single]] kilowatt hours of electricity into multiple kilowatt hours of heat [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] electric boilers can't do this [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|therefore]] considered less [[20_Vocabulary/effective|efficient]].

I ask why Helen Oy decided to install hundreds of megawatts of these boilers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Mr Aaltonen says that they are cheaper to install than heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] having them [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] means he [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] colleagues don't have to rely entirely on the air, which is limited in terms of how much heat it can provide at scale. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|Plus]], the electric boilers can [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] to soak up surplus renewables [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] provide an electricity grid-balancing [[20_Vocabulary/serve|function]], he says.

There are no heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] in the UK that rival the systems [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] development in Denmark, Germany [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Finland. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], some new district heating networks are on the way, such as the Exeter Energy Network, which [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] supply the University of Exeter [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other customers.

The minimum [[20_Vocabulary/meant|planned]] capacity of the network is 12MW. It [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/physical trait|feature]] three 4MW air-to-water heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]], with the first unit due to become operational in 2028.

Keith [[20_Vocabulary/bakery|Baker]] at Glasgow Caledonian University, who researches district heating systems, says the UK has [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opportunities]] to make more of this technology. Water in disused [[20_Vocabulary/mining|mines]], which maintains a [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|stable]] temperature, [is beginning to supply](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lk1y582r0o) larger heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] here, for example.

[[20_Vocabulary/parcel|Post]]-[[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industrial]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] rural areas where there is [[20_Vocabulary/appropriate levels of genetic diversity|adequate]] space to install heat [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|pumps]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] heat storage tanks are "the sweet spots", he says.
