### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 1

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Sandra, I [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seem to]] [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] you had some family visitors staying with you recently

Exam Preparation [[20_Vocabulary/material|Materials]]

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah that right. My brother [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] his family were here a couple of months ago.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** OK, good. Well, I wanted to ask for your advice. I got my [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/female|her]] family visiting next month [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] as I don't have kids, I've no idea where to take them.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Right. What [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/accommodate|accommodation]]? Are they [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] stay with you in your flat?

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** No, [[20_Vocabulary/thankfully|thankfully]]. There wouldn't be room. My [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]] wants me to [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] a hotel. Do you know anywhere?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yes, I do [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]]. I always [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] people stay at the King's Hotel.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Where's that near?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** It's [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a five minutes walk from Murray Station, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] nice [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] central. It's [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] on George Street.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Oh yes, I know.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]] they're on quite [[20_Vocabulary/a tight budget|a tight budget]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] how much [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|roughly]] is it to stay there? [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you book a family room, it's [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] £125 per night. My brother paid for two [[20_Vocabulary/fold|double]] rooms [[20_Vocabulary/after all|in the end]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]] that was [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] £95 for each room.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Oh, that's not [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] bad.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] how [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] are your [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousins]]' kids?

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Twelve [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] nine. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] I want to organise some trips [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] they're here. I was thinking of doing a bus tour of the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] centre, as none of them have been here before.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Those bus tours are quite [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]]. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]] it's [[20_Vocabulary/superior|better]] to do a walking tour. It gives you a much [[20_Vocabulary/superior|better]] [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] for the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]]. There's one that starts from Colton Square. It takes a couple of hours [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] doesn't cost that much.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Sounds good. I'll [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] that up. Thanks.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] the weather's nice, one thing you could do is visit [[20_Vocabulary/the old fort|the old fort]]. You could [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] there by boat. The whole trip takes half a day.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** That's a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] good idea. I'd [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to do that myself. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the weather bad I was thinking they could go to the science museum. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] they could do that [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] I at work.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah don forget it closed on Mondays

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** They here from Saturday for four nights [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] Tuesday [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be best [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]]

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] it won't be [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] crowded then. Saturdays are [[20_Vocabulary/terrible|terrible]]. I took my kids to the [[20_Vocabulary/exhibition|exhibition]] on [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] computers there [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it was far [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] crowded. I wanted to go [[20_Vocabulary/rear|back]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it's finished now.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/a shame|That's a shame]]. My [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]]'s kids [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoyed]] that.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** There's another one starting soon on space, which [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] good [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** OK, well, I'll [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]] that to my [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]].

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|conversation]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 7 to 10. Now listen* *[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 7 to 10.*

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Have you thought [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] where to take them to eat?

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Well, I [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] all the food stalls at Clacton Market. My [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]]'s [[20_Vocabulary/vegan|vegetarian]]. I know it's one of the best places for that [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of food.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/definite|Definitely]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there'll be loads of [[20_Vocabulary/the decision-making process|choices]] for the kids [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. You need to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] there quite early, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]]. At the weekend, most of the stores [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|stop]] [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serving]] [[20_Vocabulary/meal|lunch]] at 2.30.

[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]] Good point. It's all [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] need careful [[20_Vocabulary/be timetabling|planning]]. My [[20_Vocabulary/cousin|cousin]] said [[20_Vocabulary/female|she]]'d love to take the kids to a [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] at the theatre, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] tickets are [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** I know. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] you can [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] some good deals [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you book online with [[20_Vocabulary/bargained tickets|bargained tickets]] for the following day. On some seats there a 75 [[20_Vocabulary/underestimate|discount]]

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/actually|Really]]. I must [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] some

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah There are lots of things you can do [[20_Vocabulary/free of charge|for free]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|as well]]. No need to [[20_Vocabulary/spend a fortune|spend a fortune]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|Like]] what?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** They're coming next month, right? Well, [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] see [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] it's the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] weekend as the Roots Music Festival in Blakewell Gardens.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** R-O-O-T-S?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah, [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] it out online. It's always [[20_Vocabulary/a family-friendly event|a family-friendly event]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there's no [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|entry]] [[20_Vocabulary/accuse|charge]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** That sounds perfect.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you're in Blakewell Gardens, climb Telegraph Hill. You'll be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] right down on the port. Everyone's always [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressed]] because it's [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Oh yeah, I've been meaning to do that for ages. I've heard the view's amazing.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah, it's [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] the [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|effort]].

We've [[20_Vocabulary/merely|only]] [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] started offering these [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they can be booked online. Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 15 to 20 Now, the [[20_Vocabulary/arena|stadium]] you see today was built in 1989 as [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] a three-year redevelopment [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]]. [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|While]] that [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] was going on, the team had to play its matches at the ground of another club. [[20_Vocabulary/Apart from|Apart from]] that, the club has been here on this site since 1870. [[20_Vocabulary/As some of you may know|As some of you may know]], that was the start of a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] [[20_Vocabulary/decade|decade]] in the history of football in this country. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For example]], 1870 was [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] the year that football teams started to [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] a player whose role it was to [[20_Vocabulary/guard|guard]] the [[20_Vocabulary/objective|goal]]. It's hard to [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|imagine]] what the game must have been [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] someone in that [[20_Vocabulary/placement|position]], isn't it? In 1872 [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] 73, many other clubs were [[20_Vocabulary/establish|established]], both here [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/abroad|abroad]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] the following year, in 1874, [[20_Vocabulary/referees|referees]] were allowed to send players off [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they [[20_Vocabulary/commit|committed]] [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|certain]] [[20_Vocabulary/offences|offences]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] in that year teams started having to swap ends at half-time. One fact I was [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested]] to [[20_Vocabulary/discover|discover]] was that in early football games the [[20_Vocabulary/objective|aim]] was for the [[20_Vocabulary/scorer|scorer]] to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] the ball between two flag posts [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] later between sticks joined at the top with a [[20_Vocabulary/piece|piece]] of [[20_Vocabulary/tape|tape]]. In 1875, that [[20_Vocabulary/tape|tape]] was replaced with [[20_Vocabulary/the solid crossbar|the solid crossbar]] that we're familiar with today. 1877 saw the founding of further new clubs [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the history books tell us that in the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] year all the clubs decided to [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] a [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|limit]] of 90 minutes for each match Before that it was a more [[20_Vocabulary/formal|casual]] [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|arrangement]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] this sometimes caused [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] [[20_Vocabulary/arguments|arguments]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sometimes fights during matches [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] one team called the end of the game [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the other team wanted to play on to [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/mark|score]] a winning [[20_Vocabulary/objective|goal]]. By 1878, the number of teams in the Football League increased [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|again]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|In addition]], [[20_Vocabulary/referees|referees]] started using whistles [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] electric lamps were installed on [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|certain]] [[20_Vocabulary/the pitch|pitches]]. This was a [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]], as games could then be played in the evenings all year round. In 1880, clubs began to [[20_Vocabulary/accuse|charge]] fans for [[20_Vocabulary/admission|admission]] to games, [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] players were still [[20_Vocabulary/amateurs|amateurs]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] had other proper jobs. That's hard to [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|imagine]] in the modern professional game. where top players earn [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|significant]] sums of money from both playing [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/commercial|commercial]] activities.

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** How are you getting on with the [[20_Vocabulary/placement|assignment]] on [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]]?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Not [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] bad. You know, I hadn't realised that children [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|benefit]] in [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] many ways from learning to write. It's such an [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] [[20_Vocabulary/technical competence|skill]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/yet|yet]] most people [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] is less [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] than [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|in the past]], because people hardly ever write by hand these days.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] all the [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] suggests children [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] learn to write by hand before they learn to [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]], [[20_Vocabulary/not least because|not least because]] it helps their memory.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** That's right. [[20_Vocabulary/the physical act of writing|The physical act of writing]] helps children to [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] [[20_Vocabulary/letters|letters]]. That seems pretty [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obvious]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] you [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] it.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** What's less [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obvious]] is how it helps [[20_Vocabulary/build up|develop]] their [[20_Vocabulary/concentration|concentration]]. They have to sit still [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|focus]] on one thing.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah, that [[20_Vocabulary/aspect of handwriting|aspect of handwriting]] had never occurred to me before.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/identical|Same]] here. I'm not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] I understand how it improves children's [[20_Vocabulary/imagination|imagination]], [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Well there was that [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|study]] which showed that primary age children generated more ideas [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] they were writing by hand than using a keyboard I [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guessed]] that [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be the case.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Hmm yeah I never [[20_Vocabulary/associate|associated]] [[20_Vocabulary/spatial awareness|spatial awareness]] with [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] either. I thought [[20_Vocabulary/spatial awareness|spatial awareness]] was more to do with knowing where you are in [[20_Vocabulary/relationship|relation]] to objects or other people.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** I thought that [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] good [[20_Vocabulary/spatial awareness|spatial awareness]] is [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] for writing because you have to space words [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|correctly]]. It's not [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] fine motor skills that improve through writing, as I'd always [[20_Vocabulary/undertaken on|assumed]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|Handwriting]] is [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] much harder for [[20_Vocabulary/children with dyspraxia|children with dyspraxia]], who have problems coordinating movement. It's good there are lots of things you can do in the classroom to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] them. They need [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] much more [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] with [[20_Vocabulary/letter formation|letter formation]]. You need to play lots of games to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] them [[20_Vocabulary/distinguishing|distinguish]] letter shapes. It takes a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/patience|patience]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah, I [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] the idea of using one of those pens that lights up [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you [[20_Vocabulary/press|press]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] hard. That seems [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] simple solution.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** Yes, [[20_Vocabulary/positively|absolutely]]. I'm not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] there's much you can do [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/children with dyspraxia|children with dyspraxia]] writing very slowly. It's more [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|focus]] on [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|accuracy]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] as they [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] more [[20_Vocabulary/self-confidence|confident]], [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]] they [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|eventually]] [[20_Vocabulary/accelerate|speed up]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** One quite simple thing you can do is to use grid paper. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] they write each letter in a [[20_Vocabulary/packaging|box]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that trains them to space the [[20_Vocabulary/letters|letters]] [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|correctly]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|Indeed]], that's more [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] for legibility than [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|trying]] to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] them to write in a straight line.

*Before you hear [[20_Vocabulary/the rest|the rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discussion]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 25 to 30. you. Now listen* *[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 25 to 30.*

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** For some children, it might be [[20_Vocabulary/superior|better]] to teach them to write on a laptop [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] than by hand, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] children with dyslexia. They often [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/struggling|struggle]] with [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] some [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] give up.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yeah, it's not as [[20_Vocabulary/frustration|frustrating]] for them [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] things wrong. On a keyboard, they can be more [[20_Vocabulary/will|willing]] to have a go. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I read that [[20_Vocabulary/making progress|developing]] fluency isn't any faster.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** That's right. Did you read that article on the benefits of teaching print [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] than [[20_Vocabulary/cursive|cursive]] [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]], where the [[20_Vocabulary/letters|letters]] are joined up?

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** Yes. Well, [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|in the past]], [[20_Vocabulary/cursive writing|cursive writing]] was [[20_Vocabulary/uncertain|certainly]] considered more stylish [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] educated, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|not anymore]]. Teachers' attitudes have [[20_Vocabulary/the dramatic change|changed]] because it's been [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|proved]] that [[20_Vocabulary/cursive|cursive]] is more [[20_Vocabulary/problematic|difficult]] to learn, [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|especially]] for children with [[20_Vocabulary/have cognitive difficulties|learning difficulties]] who find joining up [[20_Vocabulary/letters|letters]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/problematic|challenging]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** I [[20_Vocabulary/agreement|agree]]. I was always [[20_Vocabulary/upset|worried]] that my poor [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] affected my exam results, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] now [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] shows that I was right to [[20_Vocabulary/bother|worry]]. I'm [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] a lot of students [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it's unfair that they're [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] judged on their [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]], not [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] their knowledge.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/mark|Marks]] are [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] affected [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] examiners can read the [[20_Vocabulary/cursive writing|script]]. That is why it has always been [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to teach children to write [[20_Vocabulary/legibly|legibly]]. Do you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] the role of [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] in the future

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** I can't see that [[20_Vocabulary/the dramatic change|changing]] much. Touch typing still isn't taught in most schools, which is [[20_Vocabulary/a shame|a shame]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] that won't be necessary in the future, because people [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to write by hand on [[20_Vocabulary/the British Library’s digitised collection of programmes|digital]] devices. Anyway, teachers understand the [[20_Vocabulary/worth|value]] of [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]]. It's a [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basic]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]] [[20_Vocabulary/technical competence|skill]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** True. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], the fact is that people are writing by hand less [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] less [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/rely on|relying on]] [[20_Vocabulary/the British Library’s digitised collection of programmes|digital]] devices. That does [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|cause]] some problems.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** You [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] note-taking. There are lots of apps for that.

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] for reading historical documents, [[20_Vocabulary/Apparently|apparently]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] my mum is shocked by my [[20_Vocabulary/awful|awful]] [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spelling]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the fact that my [[20_Vocabulary/punctuation|punctuation]] is [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/inconsistent|inconsistent]]. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose so|I think]] you can put that down to [[20_Vocabulary/absence|lack]] of practice.

**[[20_Vocabulary/male|MAN]]** I expect [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]]. [[20_Vocabulary/Personally|Personally]], I miss writing by hand. I hardly ever write anything now. I [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] my

grandparents had such [[20_Vocabulary/attractively|beautiful]] [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it was [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] individual. Nobody I know [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]]

be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/identify|identify]] my [[20_Vocabulary/print writing|handwriting]] now. [[20_Vocabulary/a shame|It's a shame]].

**[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]** I know. I [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] way. I [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to write [[20_Vocabulary/a diary|a diary]] by hand [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] now I do that digitally. It [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] seems less [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|effort]] to do it that way. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] it's not [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] a problem…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

We've been looking at [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] types of conflicts that may arise between wildlife [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] humans at [[20_Vocabulary/the boundaries|the boundaries]] of protected areas, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] national parks [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/animal sanctuaries|animal sanctuaries]]. I'd [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|illustrate]] this by telling you [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] some [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] that I've been [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]] in recently in the Central African country of Zambia in the area [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the Chembe [[20_Vocabulary/the bird sanctuary|Bird Sanctuary]] which contains [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] 300 of the listed birds of Zambia These [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|include]] a number of [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] eagles hawks [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] owls that live by hunting [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] killing other birds [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] animals Now most of the people living in the [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] communities near to [[20_Vocabulary/the bird sanctuary|the bird sanctuary]] are [[20_Vocabulary/small-scale farmers|small-scale farmers]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] provide [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] social [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] ecological benefits to them. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For example]], a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/harm|damage]] can be caused to farmers' crops by [[20_Vocabulary/rodents|rodents]], [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|such as]] [[20_Vocabulary/rats|rats]], which [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/consumption|consume]] the crops as they [[20_Vocabulary/build up|grow]] in the fields, [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] after harvesting [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they weren't hunted [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] killed by the birds. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/the predatory habits|the predatory habits]] of these birds [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] protect farmers in other ways. [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|For example]], a major danger to [[20_Vocabulary/rural worker|rural workers]] is snakes, whose [[20_Vocabulary/chew|bite]] may [[20_Vocabulary/pose a threat|be dangerous]] or [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/lethal|fatal]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] have a major role in [[20_Vocabulary/worth keeping|keeping]] their populations [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] [[20_Vocabulary/manipulate|control]]. [[20_Vocabulary/resident|Local]] people have always been [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|aware]] of these benefits [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] for years, [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] before the [[20_Vocabulary/the bird sanctuary|sanctuary]] was opened in 1973, the birds played a key role in the culture of the region. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], more recently, the [[20_Vocabulary/the bird sanctuary|sanctuary]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] its birds have [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] become increasingly [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] to the community in economic terms, because [[20_Vocabulary/at present|at present]], after a [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] slow start, tourism has become an [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] source of revenue for them. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] these [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] are protected by the government, their [[20_Vocabulary/statistic|numbers]] are falling. Some of these deaths are [[20_Vocabulary/accidentally|accidental]]. Fatalities [[20_Vocabulary/take place|occur]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] birds alight on roads to catch [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] eat their prey, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are [[20_Vocabulary/impact|hit]] by fast moving traffic. Drivers in Zambia have to take special [[20_Vocabulary/caring|care]] at night, as birds may [[20_Vocabulary/regard|regard]] the quieter roads as safe places to sleep. [[20_Vocabulary/accidentally|Accidental]] deaths may [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/take place|occur]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] these birds [[20_Vocabulary/soar|fly]] close to high power lines as they may be [[20_Vocabulary/electrocution|electrocuted]] This is [[20_Vocabulary/a particular danger|a particular danger]] in the heavy rain which can [[20_Vocabulary/take place|occur]] in the region in the months from December to April [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/small-scale farmers|local farmers]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/pose a threat|pose a threat]] to these birds. [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|As well as]] growing crops, [[20_Vocabulary/small-scale farmers|small-scale farmers]] in the area [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/rear|rear]] chickens.

These provide food for the farmers' families, [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] an [[20_Vocabulary/meaningful|important]] source of income. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] they're [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] an easy [[20_Vocabulary/mark|target]] for [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] farmers may shoot these birds, which is [[20_Vocabulary/crime|illegal]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/make sense|understandable]], or they may poison the birds, which [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|again]] is [[20_Vocabulary/crime|illegal]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] can have [[20_Vocabulary/positively|negative]] effects on the ecosystem. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] how else can farmers protect their chickens from [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]]? Some people [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|believe]] that to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|prevent]] the predators from [[20_Vocabulary/settling|settling]] near the area where the chickens are kept, it's best to [[20_Vocabulary/castle|keep]] this area [[20_Vocabulary/free of charge|free]] from [[20_Vocabulary/vegetation|vegetation]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|in fact]], this is [[20_Vocabulary/counterproductive|counterproductive]], as it means the chickens have no [[20_Vocabulary/blanket|cover]] to hide in [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they'll be easier for the birds to see. Another possibility [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|prevent]] the chickens from going [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|outside]] at all [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] to [[20_Vocabulary/castle|keep]] them safe from predators inside a building, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] cost far [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] much to be a practical solution. [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|Nearly]] all the farmers reported that they spent a lot of time [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|effort]] [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|trying]] to [[20_Vocabulary/frighten|frighten]] off the [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harming]] them. Most of the farmers had [[20_Vocabulary/at least|at least]] one dog [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] said this was [[20_Vocabulary/a big help|a big help]] at scaring [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] the predators. Some of the farmers [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] reported that during [[20_Vocabulary/the breeding season|the breeding season]], [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] the chickens were [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] vulnerable, they encouraged their children to [[20_Vocabulary/watches|watch]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] the chickens [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] to [[20_Vocabulary/impact|hit]] [[20_Vocabulary/pans with a metal spoon|pans with a metal spoon]] [[20_Vocabulary/so that|so that]] the resulting noise [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] succeed in driving [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] birds that were [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|trying]] to [[20_Vocabulary/seize|seize]] [[20_Vocabulary/the young chicks|the young chicks]] None of these methods was 100 [[20_Vocabulary/effective|effective]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|as a result]] the village people told us that [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] than [[20_Vocabulary/merely|just]] using one method, they were forced to use a [[20_Vocabulary/a mixture|combination]] for them to have any [[20_Vocabulary/impact|effect]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]], these [[20_Vocabulary/bird of prey|birds of prey]] remain a major threat to the chickens' [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survival]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|cause]] [[20_Vocabulary/considerably|considerable]] economic [[20_Vocabulary/casualty|loss]] to farmers. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] we looked at the possibility of [[20_Vocabulary/a longer-term solution|a longer-term solution]] to…
