**WOMAN** I've been meaning to ask you for some advice [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] restaurants. I need to book somewhere to celebrate my sister's 30th birthday, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I liked the sound of that place you went to for your mum's 50th.

Exam preparation guides

**MAN** The Junction. Yeah, I'd [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] that for a special [[20_Vocabulary/occasion|occasion]]. We had a great time there. Everyone [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoyed]] it.

**WOMAN** Where is it [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|again]]? I can't [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]].

**MAN** It on Grayson Street [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a two walk from the station.

**WOMAN** Oh that's good I prefer not to have to [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|drive]] anywhere [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I don't want to have to walk [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] far either.

**MAN** Yes, the [[20_Vocabulary/placement|location]]'s perfect, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that's not necessarily why I'd [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] it. The food's amazing. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] fish, it's [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] the best restaurant in town for that. It's always [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/brand new|fresh]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there are lots of interesting dishes to choose from [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] all the food is good there.

**WOMAN** Is it [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]]?

**MAN** It's [[20_Vocabulary/uncertain|certainly]] not cheap, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] for a special [[20_Vocabulary/occasion|occasion]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it's fine It's got a great [[20_Vocabulary/a lively atmosphere|atmosphere]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] before [[20_Vocabulary/meal|dinner]] you can go up on the roof [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have a drink It's [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] nice up there, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] you need to book It's very [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]] as the views are spectacular.

**WOMAN** Sounds good. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] that's [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|a possibility]] then. Is there anywhere else you can [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] of?

[[20_Vocabulary/Bookshelves|Bookshelves]]

**MAN** [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you want somewhere a bit less [[20_Vocabulary/formal|formal]], then you could [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] Paloma.

**WOMAN** Where's that? I haven't heard of it.

**MAN** No, it's quite new. It's [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] been open a few months, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it's got a great [[20_Vocabulary/reputation|reputation]] already. It's in a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/attractively|beautiful]] [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] building on Bow Street.

**WOMAN** Oh, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] I know where you [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]]. Right [[20_Vocabulary/beside|beside]] the cinema.

**MAN** Yes, that's it. I've [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] been there [[20_Vocabulary/a couple of times|a couple of times]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I was [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressed]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/apron|chef]] [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to work at Don Felipe's, [[20_Vocabulary/evidently|evidently]]. I was [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/regret|sorry]] when that closed down.

**WOMAN** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] is all the food they [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serve]] Spanish, then?

**MAN** Yeah. You can [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] lots of [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]] dishes to [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]], which always works [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] well [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you're in a group.

**WOMAN** Hmm. [[20_Vocabulary/worth|Worth]] thinking [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]].

**MAN** Yeah. There's [[20_Vocabulary/a lively atmosphere|a lively atmosphere]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the waiters are [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] friendly. The [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] thing is that you need to pay a £50 [[20_Vocabulary/deposit|deposit]] to [[20_Vocabulary/book a table|book a table]].

**WOMAN** A lot of restaurants are doing that these days. I should have a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the menu to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] there is a good choice of [[20_Vocabulary/vegetarian dish|vegetarian dishes]]. A couple of my friends have stopped [[20_Vocabulary/food intake|eating]] meat

**MAN** Not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] I say the [[20_Vocabulary/variety|selection]] of those [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be quite limited.

*Before you hear the [[20_Vocabulary/relax|rest]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|conversation]], you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions five to ten. Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 5 to 10.*

**MAN** I've just thought of another idea. Have you been to the Audley?

**WOMAN** No, don't [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] I've heard of it. How's it [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spelt]]?

**MAN** A-U-D-L-E-Y. You must have heard of it. There's been a lot [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it in the [[20_Vocabulary/press|press]].

**WOMAN** I don't [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] pay much [[20_Vocabulary/attention|attention]] to that [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of thing. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] where is it [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]]?

**MAN** It's in that hotel near Baxter Bridge, on the top floor.

**WOMAN** Oh, the views [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be [[20_Vocabulary/incredible|incredible]] from up there.

**MAN** Yeah, I'd love to go. I can't [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/apron|chef]]'s name, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] she was a [[20_Vocabulary/evaluate|judge]] on that TV [[20_Vocabulary/cookery|cookery]] show recently. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] she's written a couple of [[20_Vocabulary/cookery|cookery]] books.

**WOMAN** Oh, Angela Frayne.

**MAN** That's the one. Anyway, it had [[20_Vocabulary/excell|excellent]] reviews from all the newspapers.

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

Hello [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] welcome. My name's Heather McCallum [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I'm one of the potters who work here at Edelman [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|Pottery]]. Before we go into the [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]], I just want to say a bit [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/an art form|craft]] of [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]]. Then we'll have a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] you can [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] making a pot of your own. [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Like]] many people, I'm [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you know that [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] as [[20_Vocabulary/an art form|an art form]] is tens of thousands of years [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] we know this because it [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|stands the test of time]]. Things [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/basket|baskets]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] pictures don't [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]] on the earth in the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] way that pots do. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] ancient pots are [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] in [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]] [[20_Vocabulary/piece|pieces]] they still provide a lot of information [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|past]]. There no [[20_Vocabulary/suspect|doubt]] that [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] has given archaeologists [[20_Vocabulary/a fascinating insight|a fascinating insight]] into how [[20_Vocabulary/ancient hill|ancient hills]] lived The [[20_Vocabulary/curve|shape]] of an artifact may have been [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] archaeologists can tell whether the pots were for, say, storage or [[20_Vocabulary/apron|cooking]] by examining the [[20_Vocabulary/impression|impressions]] on the [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]], the [[20_Vocabulary/scratch|scratches]] from [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]] itself can [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|reveal]] where the pots came from. When I ask people why they want to take a [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery class]] with me, they sometimes [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] these things. [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Like]] our ancestors, they hope that something they [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/last longer|last longer]] than they do, that their work, whether it is good or not, might say something [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/humanity|humanity]] many years after their death. Of course, you [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] all have your own reasons for coming here. As far as I'm concerned, what I love most is the [[20_Vocabulary/concentration|concentration]] you need to make a good pot. That focus takes you [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] from the [[20_Vocabulary/stress|stresses]] of everyday [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]]. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you're [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|elderly]], it's [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] good exercise for hands [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/wrist|wrists]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] helps with [[20_Vocabulary/arthritis|arthritis]]. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] of course, it's a fun activity for children because it's [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/scruffy|messy]]. Here at Edelman [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|Pottery]], we show you some of the [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basic]] [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] techniques [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] that you can use these to [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] whatever you wish. A gift for a friend, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]]. [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|Like]] [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|nearly]] everyone who comes here, I'm [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] this is the first time you [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] have tried the art [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] we'll [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] things simple today. Now, before we move on, can I just say a word [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] what you're wearing? As we said in our email please [[20_Vocabulary/remove|remove]] any [[20_Vocabulary/watches|watches]], [[20_Vocabulary/necklaces|necklaces]] etc [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] put them somewhere safe. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you have long hair do [[20_Vocabulary/knot|tie]] it back now. We provide [[20_Vocabulary/apron|aprons]] later [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I trust your clothes are [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/comfortable|comfortable]], not your [[20_Vocabulary/favourite|favourite]] T-shirt or jeans.

Exam preparation guides

*Before you hear the [[20_Vocabulary/relax|rest]] of the talk, you have some time to [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at questions 17 to 20. Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 17 to 20.*

[[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] now we're in the [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]]. [[20_Vocabulary/Have a look around|Have a look around]]. There's a lot going on. To make [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] that [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]], you need a [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|potter's wheel]], [[20_Vocabulary/a kiln|a kiln]], which is [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basically]] a very hot oven where you fire the [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] some [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], first, the kiln. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you [[20_Vocabulary/look over|look over]] in the far corner, you'll see one of ours. Since their [[20_Vocabulary/invent|invention]], [[20_Vocabulary/a kiln|kilns]] have changed very [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|little]], [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|in the past]] 20 years a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/making progress|progress]] has been made in temperature [[20_Vocabulary/dominates political|control]]. [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|Basically]], [[20_Vocabulary/a kiln|a kiln]] removes the water from [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]] at temperatures of [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] 1000 degrees Celsius. This allows anything you've made to [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] [[20_Vocabulary/permanently|permanently]] [[20_Vocabulary/in shape|in shape]]. It's a pretty ugly heavy object that's hard to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] in a house or flat, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] most people don't have one.

You may [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], can't I use my oven? Well, that's [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/domestic oven|domestic ovens]] don't [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] hot enough [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|eventually]] the [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]] [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] crack [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/fall apart|fall apart]]. Some people fire [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] in a fire pit [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|outside]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|bear in mind]]… that can be dangerous. You [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] need to know [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] safety [[20_Vocabulary/safety procedure|procedures]] for [[20_Vocabulary/a kiln|kilns]] as they release [[20_Vocabulary/toxic|toxic]] compounds into the air. Every [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|potter]] needs a [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|potter's wheel]]. This machine is [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to [[20_Vocabulary/curve|shape]] the [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]] into an object with [[20_Vocabulary/circular wall|circular walls]] or sides, such as [[20_Vocabulary/a bowl|a bowl]]. Its [[20_Vocabulary/invent|invention]] revolutionised the [[20_Vocabulary/pottery|pottery]] [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]], allowing multiple [[20_Vocabulary/agenda|items]] to be produced in a day. [[20_Vocabulary/Lastly|Lastly]], there are a number of different [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]] that potters use, depending on what they want to make. When you start, your hands can make all kinds of shapes [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] curves [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] [[20_Vocabulary/rely on|relying on]] [[20_Vocabulary/a sculpting tool|a sculpting tool]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], there are some [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basic]] [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]] that you [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] need to [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|handle]] the [[20_Vocabulary/clay|clay]] on the wheel. Some [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] very strange [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] odder names that you may find hard to [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]]. Rather than [[20_Vocabulary/go through|go through]] them all now, I'll just name a few [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|tools]] as we go along. We can provide these [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I wouldn't [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] spending money on them yet. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], let's [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] making a pot of your own. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you sit down…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

**TAMARA** [[20_Vocabulary/will|Shall]] we [[20_Vocabulary/go through|go through]] the notes we've made from our [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] into [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] now, Dev?

**DEV** OK, Tamara. It's been [[20_Vocabulary/a real eye-opener|a real eye-opener]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/had no idea|had no idea]] that [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] has been increasing [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|steadily]] for the [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]] 20 years.

**TAMARA** I know. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] it's the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] all [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] the world. The [[20_Vocabulary/downside|downside]] of [[20_Vocabulary/a modern lifestyle|a modern lifestyle]], I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]].

**DEV** Did you come to any conclusions [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] what the reasons for the [[20_Vocabulary/build up|increase]] are?

**TAMARA** Well, I'd [[20_Vocabulary/undertaken on|assumed]] it was [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] an issue for the [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|elderly]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|in fact]] it's something which affects young people just as much.

**DEV** [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] nothing [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] to do with longer lifespans. What [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/social media|social media]]? [[20_Vocabulary/In my case|In my case]], far from

making me [[20_Vocabulary/feel isolated|feel isolated]], it [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] does the [[20_Vocabulary/opposite|opposite]]. it?

**TAMARA** It [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] does more good than [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]]. I'd say [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] has a lot to do with the way cities are [[20_Vocabulary/meant|designed]]. People living in high flats with not much [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opportunity]] to speak to their [[20_Vocabulary/neighbour|neighbours]]

**DEV** I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] you right

**TAMARA** Another [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] reason is that people are having fewer children [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] don't live in large [[20_Vocabulary/extended family|extended family]] groups.

**DEV** [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] in this country anyway, that all changed [[20_Vocabulary/decade|decades]] ago. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] yet [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] is a more recent problem.

**TAMARA** I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]]. [[20_Vocabulary/A more plausible explanation|A more plausible explanation]] is that people are having to move [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] for work [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] often end up living miles [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] from their family [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] friends.

**DEV** That's true.

**TAMARA** Looking at the studies on [[20_Vocabulary/health risk|health risks]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]], there are [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claims]] that [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] has as much [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] as [[20_Vocabulary/cigarette|smoking]] 15 [[20_Vocabulary/cigarette|cigarettes]] a day.

**DEV** Or similar to the risks caused by [[20_Vocabulary/obesity|obesity]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I'm not [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] there's enough [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] for some of these [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claims]].

**TAMARA** Well, what [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that one in Finland, which showed that [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] increased the [[20_Vocabulary/endanger|risk]] of [[20_Vocabulary/cancer|cancer]] by [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] 10%? [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] those findings have been [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|supported]] by other studies [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

**DEV** You're right [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that one. I was [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] thinking of the studies on [[20_Vocabulary/dementia|dementia]]. Some [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] no [[20_Vocabulary/association|association]] between [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/dementia|dementia]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] others [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] the [[20_Vocabulary/opposite|opposite]].

**TAMARA** Not [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]] reliable, then. There's been a lot of [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] on [[20_Vocabulary/cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disease]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] whether [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] contributes to that.

**DEV** Yes, I read that it was [[20_Vocabulary/hard to reach a judgement|hard to reach a judgement]], as the [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definition]] of [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] varied quite a lot, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the responses from participants were [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] [[20_Vocabulary/subjective|subjective]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] there's no [[20_Vocabulary/suspect|doubt]] that [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] contributes to [[20_Vocabulary/a weakened immune system|a weakened immune system]].

**TAMARA** [[20_Vocabulary/Unquestionably|Unquestionably]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/statistic|data]] on that is sound.

**DEV** What did you [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/evolutionary theory|evolutionary theory]] of [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]]?

**TAMARA** Well I thought the idea that [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] evolved because it motivated people to be with other people is quite [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|convincing]]. [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|Survival]] often depended on [[20_Vocabulary/group cooperation|group cooperation]].

**DEV** [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I don [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] there is enough [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] to [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claim]] that there must be a group of [[20_Vocabulary/a group of neuron|neurons]] in our brains which [[20_Vocabulary/impact|influence]] social behaviour by making us [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] bad when we're [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]].

**TAMARA** There are a few studies which [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] the theory, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] not [[20_Vocabulary/conclusively|conclusively]] enough. More [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] is needed.

**DEV** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] anyway, this theory's not [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]] when it comes to solving the problem of [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] today.

**TAMARA** True.

*Now listen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] answer questions 27 to 30.*

**DEV** Should we [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at the [[20_Vocabulary/relationship|relationship]] between [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|mental health]] now?

**TAMARA** OK. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/depression|depression]] are [[20_Vocabulary/Apparently|clearly]] related [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that's been recognised by various governments [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the world. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|unlike]] [[20_Vocabulary/depression|depression]], [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] has no recognised [[20_Vocabulary/clinical form|clinical form]].

**DEV** There's no available [[20_Vocabulary/diagnosis|diagnosis]] or [[20_Vocabulary/effective|effective]] [[20_Vocabulary/treatment|treatment]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that's not likely to [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]].

**TAMARA** I don't [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] either I was thinking we should start our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]] with an example from our own [[20_Vocabulary/go through|experience]] I [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|talk about]] how [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|lonely]] I was when I started university [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|away]] from home for the first time [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] all that

**DEV** Good idea. Everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to relate to that [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] a lot of students were [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] [[20_Vocabulary/embarrass|embarrassed]] to [[20_Vocabulary/admit|admit]] to it.

**TAMARA** Yeah. We could [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discuss]] ways of [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|dealing]] with [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|as well]], [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] just talking to strangers.

**DEV** Loads of studies have shown that interactions with shop assistants [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] bar staff make people [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] more [[20_Vocabulary/optimistic|optimistic]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relaxed]].

**TAMARA** I don't know [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] that, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it must make people [[20_Vocabulary/Feeing|feel]] more connected with their community.

**DEV** True, [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] you need to be a [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|certain]] [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of person to be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to just [[20_Vocabulary/strike up a conversation|strike up a conversation]].

**TAMARA** Good point. We should say something [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/solitude|solitude]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] how [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|lonely]] aren't the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]] thing. It's strange the way some people can't stand [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|by themselves]] [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] others love it.

**DEV** Yeah, the [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] shows a [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|certain]] amount of [[20_Vocabulary/solitude|solitude]] is [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|beneficial for]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|wellbeing]], which I appreciate, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]] isn't something I [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]] [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]]. I'd never choose to [[20_Vocabulary/go on|go on]] holiday [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]], for example.

**TAMARA** [[20_Vocabulary/Me neither|Me neither]].

**DEV** Well, let's not… you

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

It's quite hard to [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] of a [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] that doesn't have a big river running through it. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] the major cities in the world, Shanghai, New York, Mumbai, London, they're [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|nearly]] all built on rivers. When these cities were [[20_Vocabulary/establish|established]] hundreds or [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] thousands of years ago, the rivers were a big [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] people's lives. In 16th century London, the quickest way to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] from one [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] to another was by river. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] people [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] the river for fishing, as the water then was [[20_Vocabulary/relatively|relatively]] clean, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/go on|go on]] [[20_Vocabulary/boat trip|boat trips]] up [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] down the river just for [[20_Vocabulary/pleasure|pleasure]], as a [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relaxing]] escape from [[20_Vocabulary/the noise and bustle|the noise and bustle]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] streets [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] as industries [[20_Vocabulary/built up|developed]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] populations increased [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] rivers suffered The rising number of people [[20_Vocabulary/meant|meant]] there was a [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] [[20_Vocabulary/build up|increase]] in the amount of [[20_Vocabulary/sewage|sewage]] [[20_Vocabulary/discharge|discharged]] into the rivers. Rivers had always been [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] for this purpose, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] when [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|the number of inhabitants]] was [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|small]], that wasn't such a problem. [[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], as cities grew to [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] a million [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|inhabitants]], the [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] the rivers became more serious. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|In addition]], other types of [[20_Vocabulary/carbon emission|pollution]] increased, as factories were built [[20_Vocabulary/beside|beside]] the river [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/discharge|discharged]] their [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] [[20_Vocabulary/material|materials]] into the water. This got worse [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] time. As recently as 1957, scientists at London's Natural History Museum [[20_Vocabulary/declare|declared]] that the River Thames was dead in biological terms, as the water was [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] [[20_Vocabulary/filthy|filthy]] to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] any [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] in recent years, as rivers [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] their [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industrial function]], cities have begun to recognise their true [[20_Vocabulary/worth|value]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] to [[20_Vocabulary/take steps to|take steps to]] clean them up. For example, the River Thames is now cleaner than it's been for 150 years. These days you can see seals swimming in the water, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] recently people had to [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|rescue]] a whale, which had got [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/swam up|swam up]] the river from the sea by mistake. [[20_Vocabulary/Unfortunately|Unfortunately]], they didn't succeed, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] the problem was [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|disorientation]] rather than the [[20_Vocabulary/attribute|quality]] of the water. Then, all [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the world, [[20_Vocabulary/riverside|riverside]] areas are now seen as prime sites for development. [[20_Vocabulary/Warehouse|Warehouses]] that were [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] for storing [[20_Vocabulary/goods|goods]] are now [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] [[20_Vocabulary/convert|converted]] into [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]] restaurants [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] into apartments with river views, which are in great demand [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sell for [[20_Vocabulary/astronomical price|astronomical prices]]. In Los Angeles, on the west [[20_Vocabulary/coastal area|coast]] of the USA, an architect has plans to [[20_Vocabulary/revitalise|revitalise]] the banks of the river [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] to make a park there which can provide [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]] for sports [[20_Vocabulary/as well as|as well as]] a natural [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]] for [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relaxing]] in It [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] hoped that the [[20_Vocabulary/riverside|riverside]] can be [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] for other purposes It's been [[20_Vocabulary/propose|proposed]] that [[20_Vocabulary/facilities|facilities]] could be provided for displaying projects [[20_Vocabulary/associate|related to]] various kinds of art that have been produced by [[20_Vocabulary/resident|local]] people, for example. In the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] of Paris, During the summer months of July [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] August, all the traffic is banned from the roads by the sides of the river, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the banks are transformed into beaches, where people can [[20_Vocabulary/relax|relax]] in [[20_Vocabulary/deck chair|deck chairs]] [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] potted palm trees, [[20_Vocabulary/sunbathe|sunbathe]] or buy a drink or a snack [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoying]] the view. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] to make the most of our rivers in our increasingly crowded cities, we need to allow them to [[20_Vocabulary/regain|regain]] their original purpose [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] be [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] as a means of transport, [[20_Vocabulary/reclaiming|reclaiming]] our streets from cars [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|lorries]]. To do this, we'll have to [[20_Vocabulary/shift|shift]] more traffic back to the river, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this time cleanly [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] silently, making the most of modern technology. Already, more than two billion [[20_Vocabulary/passenger|passengers]] use the [[20_Vocabulary/ferry|ferry]] to travel in cities [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|around]] the world, [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|like]] Istanbul, San Francisco [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] New York, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these [[20_Vocabulary/statistic|numbers]] are [[20_Vocabulary/gel|set]] to rise further. [[30_Structures/Admittedly, it's not a fast way of travelling, but neither is a car when it's stuck in traffic|Admittedly, it's not a fast way of travelling, but neither is a car when it's stuck in traffic]]. Of course, [[20_Vocabulary/passenger|passenger]] traffic on roads might decrease as more people start [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] from home, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] another recent development, the [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|huge]] rise in online shopping, has [[20_Vocabulary/meant|meant]] that another [[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]] of [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|urban]] traffic just keeps on growing, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that's deliveries. [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|Trucks]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] vans in the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] pollute [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] double-park [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] dropping off [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|parcels]]. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|Imagine]] using [[20_Vocabulary/the immense capacity of shipping|the immense capacity of shipping]] to take these [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|trucks]] off the road. One [[20_Vocabulary/freight barge|freight barge]] can replace 44 large [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|trucks]], uses far less energy [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] causes less [[20_Vocabulary/carbon emission|pollution]] When the [[20_Vocabulary/freight barge|barge]] docks at the [[20_Vocabulary/riverside|riverside]] the [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|parcels]] could be taken the [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]] few kilometres to their [[20_Vocabulary/ultimate|final]] destination on [[20_Vocabulary/goods|cargo]] bikes, electric ones of course. This is already happening in the Dutch [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] of Amsterdam, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] in future the [[20_Vocabulary/ultimate|final]] [[20_Vocabulary/arena|stage]] could [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] be carried out by [[20_Vocabulary/drone|drone]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] at [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|present]] this isn't allowed. Wouldn't it be great to unblock our [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] centres [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|in this way]]? Looking further ahead…
