[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Hi Coleman, how are you?

COLEMAN: Good, thanks.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: I wanted to have a chat with you because our friend Josh told me that you’ve joined a guitar group [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it sounds interesting. I’d [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to learn myself.

COLEMAN: Why don’t you [[20_Vocabulary/come along|come along]]? I’m [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] there’s room for another person.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: [[20_Vocabulary/actually|Really]]? [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] – who runs the classes?

COLEMAN: He’s called a ‘coordinator’ – his name’s Gary Mathieson. ***Q1***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Let me note that down. Gary.... How do you [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spell]] his surname?

COLEMAN: It’s M-A-T-H-I-E-S-O-N.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Right, thanks.

COLEMAN: He’s [[20_Vocabulary/retire|retired]], [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] he’s a [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] nice guy [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to play in a lot of bands.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Thanks. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] how long have you been going?

COLEMAN: [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|About]] a month now.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] could you play anything before you started?

COLEMAN: I knew [[20_Vocabulary/a few chords|a few chords]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that’s all.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: I’m [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be better than me.

COLEMAN: That’s what I thought, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] I first spoke to Gary on the phone, he said it was a class for beginners, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I was still [[20_Vocabulary/upset|worried]] that everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be better than me, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we were [[20_Vocabulary/all equally hopeless|all equally hopeless]]! ***Q2***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Oh, that’s [[20_Vocabulary/reassuring|reassuring]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] where do you meet?

COLEMAN: Well, [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] I joined the group, they were [[20_Vocabulary/conference|meeting]] in Gary’s home, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town. I prefer going there. ***Q3***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: I know that place. I [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to go to tap dancing classes there [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] I was at secondary school. I haven’t been since, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I can’t [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] what road it’s in… is it Lock Street?

COLEMAN: It’s just [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|beyond]] there at the bottom of New Street near the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] roundabout. ***Q4***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Yes, of course.

COLEMAN: The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Right. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] do you meet? Is it at the weekend?

COLEMAN: We meet on Thursdays. It [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to be 10.30 [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[30_Structures/that suited me well|that suited me well]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] now we meet at 11. The class that’s in there before us asked [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they could have the room for another 30 minutes. ***Q5***

[[20_Vocabulary/Bookshelves|Bookshelves]]

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Oh, I see. Well, I’d love to [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I don’t have a guitar.

COLEMAN: Well, you can always buy a [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] one. There’s a website called ‘The perfect instrument ’ that sells all kinds of guitars, violins [[20_Vocabulary/That sort of thing|and so on]]. I’m [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] you’ll find something there. ***Q6***

————————————–

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] what’s a [[20_Vocabulary/average|typical]] lesson [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] with Gary?

COLEMAN: Well, he always starts by getting us to [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] our guitars. That takes [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] five minutes.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Uhuh.

COLEMAN: Some people have an app they use, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] others do it by ear. Gary goes round [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] helps them. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] he’s doing that, he tells us what he’s [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] do during the lesson. ***Q7***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Right.

COLEMAN: First, we usually spend [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] ten minutes doing some [[20_Vocabulary/strumming|strumming]].

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] is that using... what are they called... [[20_Vocabulary/plectrums|plectrums]]?

COLEMAN: No – we just use our [[20_Vocabulary/thumbs|thumbs]].

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Much easier.

COLEMAN: Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then we play them together. Sometimes we all just start laughing because we’re [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] bad at [[20_Vocabulary/worth keeping|keeping]] time, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] Gary starts clapping to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] us. ***Q8***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Do you learn to play any songs?

COLEMAN: Yes – we do [[20_Vocabulary/at least|at least]] one song with words [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chords]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] that’s harder than you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]].

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Oh, I’m [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|sure]] it is!

COLEMAN: That [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] the lesson takes [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] 15 minutes. He often brings a recording of the song [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] plays it to us first. Then he [[20_Vocabulary/hands out the song|hands out the song]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] there’s a new [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] in it, we practise that before we play it together – [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] slowly. ***Q9***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Do you do any [[20_Vocabulary/finger picking|finger picking]]?

COLEMAN: That’s the [[20_Vocabulary/lasts|last]] ten minutes of the lesson, [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] we [[20_Vocabulary/plectrums|pick]] out the individual notes from a [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] he’s made up. It’s always quite simple.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: That must be hard, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]].

COLEMAN: It is, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] people [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] it because they can [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/narrow the topic down|concentrate]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we’re all playing well, it sounds quite [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressive]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] [[20_Vocabulary/bother|trouble]] is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time – you know, [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]]. ***Q10***

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: That’s [[20_Vocabulary/scary|scary]].

COLEMAN: It is, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’ve got [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to it now. At the end he spends [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.

[[20_Vocabulary/female|WOMAN]]: Well, thanks Coleman. I’ll go [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at that website, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]].

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

I never [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/meant|planned]] to be [[20_Vocabulary/a lifeboat volunteer|a lifeboat volunteer]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] I came to live in [[20_Vocabulary/Northsea|Northsea]]. I’d been [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] in London as [[20_Vocabulary/a website designer|a website designer]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] that was interesting, I didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]]. I’d been [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]] [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen on]] boats as [[20_Vocabulary/a teenager|a teenager]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I thought [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] I went to live by the sea, I might be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|pursue]] that interest [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|a bit]] more in my [[20_Vocabulary/free of charge|free]] time. Then I [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that the Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] was looking for volunteers, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] I decided to apply. ***Q11***

The Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] building here in [[20_Vocabulary/Northsea|Northsea]]’s hard to miss; it’s one of the largest in the country. It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a [[20_Vocabulary/generous|generous]] [[20_Vocabulary/participant|member]] of the [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]], who’d lived here all [[20_Vocabulary/female|her]] [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]]. As the Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] is [[20_Vocabulary/a charity|a charity]] that relies on that [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of [[20_Vocabulary/fundraising|donation]], [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] than funding provided by the government, that [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] is much needed. ***Q12***

[[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] I applied, I had to have a [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]]. The doctors were [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested in]] my [[20_Vocabulary/vision|vision]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to be [[20_Vocabulary/short-sighted|short-sighted]], [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] I’d had to [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] glasses, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I’d had [[20_Vocabulary/laser eye surgery|laser eye surgery]] two years earlier [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] that was OK. They gave me tests for [[20_Vocabulary/colour blindness|colour blindness]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they thought I might have a problem there, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it [[20_Vocabulary/turned out|turned out]] I was OK. ***Q13***

[[20_Vocabulary/in case of|When]] [[20_Vocabulary/the coastguard|the coastguard]] gets [[20_Vocabulary/an alert|an alert]], all the volunteers are contacted [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/rush to|rush to]] the lifeboat station. Our [[20_Vocabulary/mark|target]]’s to [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] there in five minutes, then we [[20_Vocabulary/attempt|try]] to [[20_Vocabulary/get the boat off the dock|get the boat off the dock]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] out to sea in another six to eight minutes. Our team’s proud that we usually [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|achieve]] that – the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] time across the country’s eight [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] a half minutes. ***Q14***

I have to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] that the [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]] we use is in [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] – we have special [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]] jackets that can [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] up four people in the water. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/after all|ultimately]] my [[20_Vocabulary/the decision-making process|decision]] whether it’s safe to [[20_Vocabulary/launch in favour|launch]] the boat. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] it’s very rare not to [[20_Vocabulary/launch in favour|launch]], [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] in the worst weather. ***Q15***

[[20_Vocabulary/as well as|As well as]] going out on the lifeboat, my work [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involves]] other things [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. A lot of people [[20_Vocabulary/underestimate|underestimate]] how windy conditions can [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] at sea, [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] I speak to [[20_Vocabulary/a teenager|youth]] groups [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sailing clubs in the area [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] [[20_Vocabulary/the sorts of problems|the sorts of problems]] that sailors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] swimmers can have [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the weather suddenly gets bad. We [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we couldn’t [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|manage]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] them. ***Q16***

I was glad I’d done a first [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|aid]] course before I started, as that’s a big [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] with the [[20_Vocabulary/casualty|casualty]] [[20_Vocabulary/caring|care]] activities we do. We’ve done a lot on how to deal with [[20_Vocabulary/rope|ropes]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/knot|tie]] [[20_Vocabulary/knot|knots]] – that’s an [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] [[20_Vocabulary/technical competence|skill]].

They had [[20_Vocabulary/a wave-tank|a wave-tank]] where they could [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] extreme weather conditions – [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] we could [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/go through|experience]] at what to do [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the boat turned [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] in a storm at night, [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|for example]]. ***Q17/18***

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

BELLA: Hi Don – did you [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] the copy of the article on [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] that I emailed you?

DON: Yeah – it’s here … I’ve had a [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] at it.

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] do you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it’s a good topic for our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]]?

DON: Well, before I started reading it, I thought [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]], well, [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] it’s quite interesting, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]] there isn’t enough to say [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it, cos we put [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] in [[20_Vocabulary/recycling bin|recycling bins]], they go to [[20_Vocabulary/charity shop|charity shops]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that’s [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] it. ***Q21***

Shop for bestsellers

BELLA: … [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there’s much more to it than that.

DON: I realise that now [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I’m [[20_Vocabulary/eager to|keen to]] [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] the topic more.

BELLA: That’s great.

DON: One of the things I didn’t realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|trainers]] [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycled]]!

BELLA: Well, a lot of young people [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] them all the time now. They’ve become more [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]] than [[20_Vocabulary/average|ordinary]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]].

DON: I know. I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] they are very [[20_Vocabulary/hard-wearing|hard-wearing]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] don’t they [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|a bit]] [[20_Vocabulary/formal|casual]] for school [[20_Vocabulary/apron|uniform]]? I don’t [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] they’re right for that. ***Q22***

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/actually|Actually]], I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] some of them [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] quite smart on [[20_Vocabulary/pupil|pupils]] … better than a [[20_Vocabulary/scruffy|scruffy]] [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] pair of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]].

DON: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] do you [[20_Vocabulary/castle|keep]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] a long time?

BELLA: Yes. [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|Though]] I do [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] my [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] pairs for doing [[20_Vocabulary/filthy|dirty]] jobs [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] cleaning my bike.

BELLA: I must [[20_Vocabulary/admit|admit]], I’ve [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycled]] some perfectly good [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]], that haven’t [[20_Vocabulary/go out of fashion|gone out of fashion]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] still fit, just because they don’t [[30_Structures/look great on me|look great on me]] any more. That’s [[20_Vocabulary/awful|awful]] isn’t it? ***Q23***

DON: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it’s [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|common]] because there’s [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] much choice. The article did say that recent sales of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] have increased [[20_Vocabulary/enormous|enormously]].

BELLA: That didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprise]] me.

DON: No. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] then it said that the amount of [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycled]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] has fallen: it’s 6 percent now [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|compared to]] a previous level of 11 percent. That doesn’t [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seem to]] [[20_Vocabulary/make sense|make sense]]. ***Q24***

BELLA: That’s because not everything goes through the [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] process. Some [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] just isn’t good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] gets [[20_Vocabulary/reject|rejected]].

——————————————-

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] let’s find some examples in the article of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] that was [[20_Vocabulary/reject|rejected]] for [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]].

DON: OK. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] there are some in the interview with the [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] [[20_Vocabulary/supervisor|manager]]. Yeah – here it is.

BELLA: Mmm. Let’s start with the ladies’ [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|high-heeled shoes]]. What did he say [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] those?

DON: He said they were [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]] – the [[20_Vocabulary/material|material]] was [[20_Vocabulary/suede|suede]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they were [[20_Vocabulary/beige in colour|beige in colour]] – it looked [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] someone had [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] them [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] in a very [[20_Vocabulary/wet field|wet field]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] the heels were [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] [[20_Vocabulary/stain|stained]] with [[20_Vocabulary/mud|mud]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grass]] to re-sell them. ***Q25***

BELLA: OK … [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the [[20_Vocabulary/leather|leather]] [[20_Vocabulary/ankle boot|ankle boots]]. What was wrong with them?

DON: [[20_Vocabulary/Apparently|Apparently]], the heels were [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] – [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that wasn’t the problem. One of the [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] was a much lighter [[20_Vocabulary/shade|shade]] than the other one – it had [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obviously]] been left in the sun. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] the [[20_Vocabulary/identical|same]]! ***Q26***

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/inevitable|Sure]]. Then there were the red [[20_Vocabulary/toddler|baby]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]].

DON: Oh yes – we’re told to [[20_Vocabulary/knot|tie]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] together [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] we put them in a [[20_Vocabulary/recycling bin|recycling bin]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] people often don’t [[20_Vocabulary/bother|bother]].

BELLA: You’d [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have been easy to find the other, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it wasn’t. [[30_Structures/That was a shame|That was a shame]] because they were [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obviously]] new. ***Q27***

DON: The [[20_Vocabulary/trainer|trainers]] were interesting. He said they looked [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] they’d been [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] by a marathon runner.

BELLA: Yeah – weren’t they [[20_Vocabulary/split|split]]?

DON: Not [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]]. One of the [[20_Vocabulary/sole|soles]] was [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] [[20_Vocabulary/Beneath|under]] the foot that you could put your finger through it. ***Q28***

BELLA: Well, we could [[20_Vocabulary/uncertain|certainly]] use some of those examples in our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]] to explain why 90 percent of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] that people take to [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] centres or bins [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] thrown into [[20_Vocabulary/landfill|landfill]].

DON: Mmm. What did you [[20_Vocabulary/reflect on|think about]] the [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] his team [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|set up]] to [[20_Vocabulary/prevent|avoid]] this by making new [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] the good parts of [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]]?

BELLA: It sounded [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] a good idea. They [[20_Vocabulary/obtain|get]] [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] many [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]], they [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to match parts. I wasn’t [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprised]] that it failed, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] who wants to buy [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] [[20_Vocabulary/actually|really]]? [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|Think]] of all the [[20_Vocabulary/germ|germs]] you could catch!

DON: Well, people didn’t [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|refuse]] them for that reason, did they? It was because the pairs of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] weren’t [[20_Vocabulary/identical|identical]]. ***Q29***

BELLA: They still managed to ship them [[20_Vocabulary/oversea|overseas]], [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]].

DON: That’s another area we need to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discuss]].

BELLA: You know I [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|consider]] this topic just from my own [[20_Vocabulary/perspective|perspective]], by thinking [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] my own [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] behaviour [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] looking at the bigger [[20_Vocabulary/illustration|picture]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] much happens [[20_Vocabulary/no longer|once]] [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|shoes]] leave the [[20_Vocabulary/waste recycling|recycling]] area.

DON: It’s not as simple as you first [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we can [[20_Vocabulary/concert|show]] that by taking a very [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|approach]] to it. ***Q30***

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/Unquestionably|Absolutely]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]] let’s [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discuss]] …

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

For my [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|project]] on [[20_Vocabulary/invertebrate|invertebrates]], I chose to [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|study]] [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]]. These are [[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] — or to be more precise — near-[[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] animals. There are well [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] a thousand known species of these [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|tiny]] animals, which [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|belong to]] the [[20_Vocabulary/phylum|phylum]] Tardigrada. Most [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] [[20_Vocabulary/variety|range]] in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre, [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] the largest species can [[20_Vocabulary/build up|grow]] to be 1.2 millimetres in length. They are [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] sometimes called ‘water bears’: ‘water’ because that’s where they thrive best, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] ‘bear’ [[20_Vocabulary/due to|because of]] the way they move. ***Q31***. ‘[[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|Moss piglet]]’ is another name for [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] [[20_Vocabulary/due to|because of]] the way they [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] viewed from the front. They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze, who [[20_Vocabulary/coined|coined]] the name *Tardigrada*.

As I say, there are many [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] species of [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]] — [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] many to describe here — [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]], [[20_Vocabulary/generally speaking|generally speaking]], the [[20_Vocabulary/otherwise|different]] species [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] similar [[20_Vocabulary/physical trait|physical traits]]. They have a [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|body]] which is [[20_Vocabulary/brief|short]], ***Q32***, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] [[20_Vocabulary/curve|rounded]] — [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|a bit]] [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/a barrel|a barrel]] — [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|body]] [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|comprises]] four [[20_Vocabulary/segment|segments]]. Each [[20_Vocabulary/segment|segment]] has a pair of legs, at the end of which are between four [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] eight sharp [[20_Vocabulary/sharp claw|claws]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|should]] [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] say that some species don’t have any [[20_Vocabulary/sharp claw|claws]]: what they have are [[20_Vocabulary/disc|discs]], ***Q33***, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these work by [[20_Vocabulary/means of suction|means of suction]]. They enable the [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]] to [[20_Vocabulary/cling|cling to]] surfaces or to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|grip]] its prey. Within the [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|body]], there are no [[20_Vocabulary/lung|lungs]], or any organs for breathing at all. Instead, oxygen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] blood are transported in [[20_Vocabulary/a fluid|a fluid]] that fills [[20_Vocabulary/the cavity of the body|the cavity of the body]]. ***Q34***

As far as the [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]]’s head is concerned, the best way I can describe this is that it [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|looks]] [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|rather]] strange — [[20_Vocabulary/a bit squashed|a bit squashed]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] — [[20_Vocabulary/whilst|though]] many of the websites I looked at described its [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|appearance]] as cute, which isn’t [[20_Vocabulary/accurately|exactly]] very scientific. The [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]]’s mouth is a [[20_Vocabulary/caring|kind]] of tube ***Q35*** that can open outwards to [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|reveal]] teeth-[[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] structures known as ‘stylets’. These are sharp enough to [[20_Vocabulary/pierce|pierce]] plant or animal cells.

[[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], where are [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]]? Well, they live in every [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] the world, in a [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]] of habitats: most commonly, on [[20_Vocabulary/the bed of a lake|the bed of a lake]], or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments. There’s been some interesting [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|research]] which has [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] are [[20_Vocabulary/capable|capable of]] [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|surviving]] [[20_Vocabulary/radiation|radiation]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] very high [[20_Vocabulary/press|pressure]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they’re [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/withstand temperature|withstand]] temperatures as low as [[20_Vocabulary/downside|minus]] –200 degrees centigrade, or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade, ***Q36***, which is [[20_Vocabulary/incredible|incredibly]] hot.

—————————————–

It has been said that [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] could [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]] long after human beings have been [[20_Vocabulary/wiped out|wiped out]], [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|in the event of]] [[20_Vocabulary/an asteroid|an asteroid]] hitting the earth. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] conditions become [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] extreme [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] are [[20_Vocabulary/at risk of drying out|at risk of drying out]], they [[20_Vocabulary/entrance|enter]] a state called [[20_Vocabulary/cryptobiosis|cryptobiosis]]. They [[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]] [[20_Vocabulary/slightly|a little]] ball, called a tun — that’s T-U-N — by [[20_Vocabulary/retract|retracting]] their head [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] legs, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] their [[20_Vocabulary/metabolism|metabolism]] drops to less than one percent of [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] levels. They can stay in this state for [[20_Vocabulary/decade|decades]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] re-introduced to water, [[20_Vocabulary/in case of|when]] they [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] back to [[20_Vocabulary/existence|life]] in a matter of a few hours. [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|While]] in this state of [[20_Vocabulary/cryptobiosis|cryptobiosis]], [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] a protein that protects their DNA. ***Q37***. In 2016, scientists revived two [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] that had been tuns for more than 30 years. There was a report that,in 1948, a 120-year-[[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] tun was revived, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this experiment has never been [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|repeated]]. There are currently several tests [[20_Vocabulary/taking place in space|taking place in space]], to [[20_Vocabulary/affect|determine]] how long [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] might be [[20_Vocabulary/capable|able]] to [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]] there. ***Q38***. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|believe]] the record [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|so]] far is 10 day.

[[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], erm, moving on. In terms of their [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]], [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] [[20_Vocabulary/consumption|consume]] liquids in [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] to [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|Although]] they have teeth, they don’t use these for [[20_Vocabulary/chew|chewing]]. They suck the juices from [[20_Vocabulary/moss|moss]], or [[20_Vocabulary/remove|extract]] fluid from [[20_Vocabulary/seaweed|seaweed]], ***Q39***, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] some species prey on other [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]], from other species or within [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] this isn’t [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprising]], given that [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] are [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] [[20_Vocabulary/comprise|comprised]] of [[20_Vocabulary/a fluid|liquid]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are [[20_Vocabulary/coat|coated]] with a [[20_Vocabulary/genre|type]] of [[20_Vocabulary/gel|gel]].

[[20_Vocabulary/after all|Finally]], I’d [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]] the [[20_Vocabulary/conservation|conservation]] status of [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]]. It is estimated that they have been in [[20_Vocabulary/existence|existence]] for [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|approximately]] half a billion years [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]], in that time, they have [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survived]] five [[20_Vocabulary/mass extinction|mass extinctions]]. [[20_Vocabulary/thereby|So]], it [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] [[20_Vocabulary/forthcoming event|come]] as no [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprise]] to you, that [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrades]] have not been [[20_Vocabulary/evaluate|evaluated]] by the International Union for [[20_Vocabulary/conservation|Conservation]] of [[20_Vocabulary/messy nature|Nature]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are not on any [[20_Vocabulary/endanger|endangered]] list. ***Q40***. Some researchers have described them as thriving.

Does anyone have any questions they’d [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] to ask?
