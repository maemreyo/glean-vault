### PART 1

WOMAN: Hi Coleman, how are you?

COLEMAN: Good, thanks.

WOMAN: I wanted to have a chat with you because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group and it sounds interesting. I'd really like to learn myself.

COLEMAN: Why don't you [[20_Vocabulary/come along|come along]]? I'm sure there's room for another person.

WOMAN: Really? So – who runs the classes?

COLEMAN: He's called a 'coordinator' – his name's Gary Mathieson. ***Q1***

WOMAN: Let me note that down. Gary.... How do you spell his surname?

COLEMAN: It's M-A-T-H-I-E-S-O-N.

WOMAN: Right, thanks.

COLEMAN: He's retired, [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]], but he's a really nice guy and he used to play in a lot of bands.

WOMAN: Thanks. So how long have you been going?

COLEMAN: About a month now.

WOMAN: And could you play anything before you started?

COLEMAN: I knew [[20_Vocabulary/a few chords|a few chords]], but that's all.

WOMAN: I'm sure everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be better than me.

COLEMAN: That's what I thought, too. When I first spoke to Gary on the phone, he said it was a class for beginners, but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me, but we were [[20_Vocabulary/all equally hopeless|all equally hopeless]]! ***Q2***

WOMAN: Oh, that's [[20_Vocabulary/reassuring|reassuring]]. So where do you meet?

COLEMAN: Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home, but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town. I prefer going there. ***Q3***

WOMAN: I know that place. I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school. I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road it's in… is it Lock Street?

COLEMAN: It's just [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|beyond]] there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout. ***Q4***

WOMAN: Yes, of course.

COLEMAN: The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.

WOMAN: Right. And when do you meet? Is it at the weekend?

COLEMAN: We meet on Thursdays. It used to be 10.30 and [[30_Structures/that suited me well|that suited me well]], but now we meet at 11. The class that's in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes. ***Q5***

[[20_Vocabulary/Bookshelves|Bookshelves]]

WOMAN: Oh, I see. Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar.

COLEMAN: Well, you can always buy a [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] one. There's a website called 'The perfect instrument ' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on. I'm sure you'll find something there. ***Q6***

————————————–

WOMAN: So what's a typical lesson like with Gary?

COLEMAN: Well, he always starts by getting us to [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] our guitars. That takes about five minutes.

WOMAN: Uhuh.

COLEMAN: Some people have an app they use, but others do it by ear. Gary goes round and helps them. And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson. ***Q7***

WOMAN: Right.

COLEMAN: First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some [[20_Vocabulary/strumming|strumming]].

WOMAN: So is that using... what are they called... [[20_Vocabulary/plectrums|plectrums]]?

COLEMAN: No – we just use our [[20_Vocabulary/thumbs|thumbs]].

WOMAN: Much easier.

COLEMAN: Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] and then we play them together. Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time, so Gary starts clapping to help us. ***Q8***

WOMAN: Do you learn to play any songs?

COLEMAN: Yes – we do [[20_Vocabulary/at least|at least]] one song with words and chords. I mean that's harder than you think.

WOMAN: Oh, I'm sure it is!

COLEMAN: That part of the lesson takes about 15 minutes. He often brings a recording of the song and plays it to us first. Then he [[20_Vocabulary/hands out the song|hands out the song]] and if there's a new [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] in it, we practise that before we play it together – but really slowly. ***Q9***

WOMAN: Do you do any [[20_Vocabulary/finger picking|finger picking]]?

COLEMAN: That's the last ten minutes of the lesson, when we pick out the individual notes from a [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] he's made up. It's always quite simple.

WOMAN: That must be hard, though.

COLEMAN: It is, but people like it because they can really concentrate and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive. The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time – you know, alone. ***Q10***

WOMAN: That's [[20_Vocabulary/scary|scary]].

COLEMAN: It is, but I've got used to it now. At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.

WOMAN: Well, thanks Coleman. I'll go and have a look at that website, I think.

### PART 2

I never really planned to be [[20_Vocabulary/a lifeboat volunteer|a lifeboat volunteer]] when I came to live in [[20_Vocabulary/Northsea|Northsea]]. I'd been working in London as [[20_Vocabulary/a website designer|a website designer]], but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life. I'd been really [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen on]] boats as [[20_Vocabulary/a teenager|a teenager]], and I thought if I went to live by the sea, I might be able to [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|pursue]] that interest a bit more in my free time. Then I found that the Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] was looking for volunteers, so I decided to apply. ***Q11***

The Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] building here in [[20_Vocabulary/Northsea|Northsea]]'s hard to miss; it's one of the largest in the country. It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a [[20_Vocabulary/generous|generous]] member of the public, who'd lived here all her life. As the Lifeboat [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|Institution]] is [[20_Vocabulary/a charity|a charity]] that relies on that kind of donation, rather than funding provided by the government, that kind of help is much needed. ***Q12***

When I applied, I had to have a health [[20_Vocabulary/assessment|assessment]]. The doctors were [[20_Vocabulary/particularly|particularly]] interested in my [[20_Vocabulary/vision|vision]]. I used to be [[20_Vocabulary/short-sighted|short-sighted]], so I'd had to wear glasses, but I'd had [[20_Vocabulary/laser eye surgery|laser eye surgery]] two years earlier [[20_Vocabulary/so that|so that]] was OK. They gave me tests for [[20_Vocabulary/colour blindness|colour blindness]] and they thought I might have a problem there, but it [[20_Vocabulary/turned out|turned out]] I was OK. ***Q13***

When [[20_Vocabulary/the coastguard|the coastguard]] gets [[20_Vocabulary/an alert|an alert]], all the volunteers are contacted and [[20_Vocabulary/rush to|rush to]] the lifeboat station. Our target's to get there in five minutes, then we try to [[20_Vocabulary/get the boat off the dock|get the boat off the dock]] and out to sea in another six to eight minutes. Our team's proud that we usually [[20_Vocabulary/achieve|achieve]] that – the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] time across the country's eight and a half minutes. ***Q14***

[[20_Vocabulary/as well as|As well as]] [[20_Vocabulary/steering|steering]] the lifeboat, as a 'helmsman', I have the [[20_Vocabulary/ultimate|ultimate]] responsibility for the lifeboat. I have to check that the [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]] we use is in working order – we have special life jackets that can support up four people in the water. And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat. But it's very rare not to launch, even in the worst weather. ***Q15***

[[20_Vocabulary/as well as|As well as]] going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too. A lot of people [[20_Vocabulary/underestimate|underestimate]] how windy conditions can change at sea, so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area about [[20_Vocabulary/the sorts of problems|the sorts of problems]] that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad. We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us, and we couldn't manage without them. ***Q16***

——————————————————–

The training we get is [[20_Vocabulary/a continuous process|a continuous process]], focusing on [[20_Vocabulary/technical competence|technical competence]] and safe handling techniques, and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without [[20_Vocabulary/panicking|panicking]]. I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started, as that's [[20_Vocabulary/a big help|a big help]] with the [[20_Vocabulary/casualty|casualty]] care activities we do. We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots – that's an [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] skill. After a year, I did [[20_Vocabulary/a one-week residential course|a one-week residential course]], led by specialists. They had [[20_Vocabulary/a wave-tank|a wave-tank]] where they could create extreme weather conditions – so we could get experience at what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example. ***Q17/18***

Since I started, I've had to deal with [[20_Vocabulary/a range of emergency situations|a range of emergency situations]].

But the work's [[20_Vocabulary/hugely|hugely]] motivating. It's not just about saving lives – I've learned a lot about the technology involved. My [[20_Vocabulary/background|background]] in IT's been useful here, and I can use my [[20_Vocabulary/expertise|expertise]] to help other volunteers. They're a great group – we're like a family really, which helps when you're [[20_Vocabulary/dragging yourself out of bed|dragging yourself out of bed]] on [[20_Vocabulary/a cold stormy night|a cold stormy night]]. But [[20_Vocabulary/actually|actually]], it's the colder months that can be [[20_Vocabulary/the most rewarding time|the most rewarding time]]. That's when the incidents [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] be more serious, and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome. ***Q19/20***

So if any of you listeners are interested…

### PART 3

BELLA: Hi Don – did you get the copy of the article on recycling [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] that I emailed you?

DON: Yeah – it's here … I've had a look at it.

BELLA: So do you think it's a good topic for our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]]?

DON: Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]], well, although it's quite interesting, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]] [[30_Structures/there isn't enough to say about it|there isn't enough to say about it]], cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops and that's about it. ***Q21***

Shop for bestsellers

BELLA: … but there's much more to it than that.

DON: I realise that now and I'm keen to research the topic more.

BELLA: That's great.

DON: One of the things I didn't realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!

BELLA: Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now. They've become more popular than ordinary shoes.

DON: I know. I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] they are very [[20_Vocabulary/hard-wearing|hard-wearing]], but don't they look a bit casual for school uniform? I don't think they're right for that. ***Q22***

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/actually|Actually]], I think some of them look quite smart on pupils … better than a [[20_Vocabulary/scruffy|scruffy]] old pair of shoes.

DON: So do you keep shoes a long time?

BELLA: Yes. Though I do [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] wear my old pairs for doing dirty jobs like cleaning my bike.

BELLA: I must [[20_Vocabulary/admit|admit]], I've recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven't gone out of fashion and still fit, just because they don't [[30_Structures/look great on me|look great on me]] any more. That's [[20_Vocabulary/awful|awful]] isn't it? ***Q23***

DON: I think it's common because there's so much choice. The article did say that recent sales of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] have increased enormously.

BELLA: That didn't [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprise]] me.

DON: No. But then it said that the amount of recycled [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] has fallen: it's 6 percent now [[20_Vocabulary/compared to|compared to]] a previous level of 11 percent. That doesn't [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seem to]] [[20_Vocabulary/make sense|make sense]]. ***Q24***

BELLA: That's because not everything goes through the recycling process. Some [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] just isn't good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, and gets rejected.

——————————————-

BELLA: So let's find some examples in the article of [[20_Vocabulary/footwear|footwear]] that was rejected for recycling.

DON: OK. I think there are some in the interview with the recycling manager. Yeah – here it is.

BELLA: Mmm. Let's start with the ladies' [[20_Vocabulary/high-heeled shoes|high-heeled shoes]]. What did he say about those?

DON: He said they were [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]] – the [[20_Vocabulary/material|material]] was [[20_Vocabulary/suede|suede]] and they were [[20_Vocabulary/beige in colour|beige in colour]] – it looked like someone had only [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] them once, but in a very [[20_Vocabulary/wet field|wet field]] so the heels were too stained with [[20_Vocabulary/mud|mud]] and [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grass]] to re-sell them. ***Q25***

BELLA: OK … and the [[20_Vocabulary/leather|leather]] ankle boots. What was wrong with them?

DON: [[20_Vocabulary/Apparently|Apparently]], the heels were [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] – but that wasn't the problem. One of the shoes was a much lighter [[20_Vocabulary/shade|shade]] than the other one – it had [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obviously]] been left in the sun. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] even [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] shoes should look the same! ***Q26***

BELLA: Sure. Then there were the red baby shoes.

DON: Oh yes – we're told to tie shoes together when we put them in a [[20_Vocabulary/recycling bin|recycling bin]], but people often don't [[20_Vocabulary/bother|bother]].

BELLA: You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't. [[30_Structures/That was a shame|That was a shame]] because they were [[20_Vocabulary/obviously|obviously]] new. ***Q27***

DON: The trainers were interesting. He said they looked like they'd been [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] by a marathon runner.

BELLA: Yeah – weren't they [[20_Vocabulary/split|split]]?

DON: Not exactly. One of the soles was so [[20_Vocabulary/worn|worn]] under the foot that you could put your finger through it. ***Q28***

BELLA: Well, we could certainly use some of those examples in our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]] to explain why 90 percent of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into [[20_Vocabulary/landfill|landfill]].

DON: Mmm. What did you think about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of old shoes?

BELLA: It sounded like a good idea. They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts. I wasn't surprised that it failed, though. I mean who wants to buy [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|second-hand]] shoes really? Think of all the germs you could catch!

DON: Well, people didn't [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|refuse]] them for that reason, did they? It was because the pairs of shoes weren't [[20_Vocabulary/identical|identical]]. ***Q29***

BELLA: They still managed to ship them overseas, though.

DON: That's another area we need to discuss.

BELLA: You know I used to consider this topic just from my own [[20_Vocabulary/perspective|perspective]], by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture. So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.

DON: It's not as simple as you first think, and we can show that by taking a very different approach to it. ***Q30***

BELLA: Absolutely. So let's discuss …

### PART 4

For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades. These are [[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] — or to be more precise — near-[[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] animals. There are well over a thousand known species of these [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|tiny]] animals, which [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|belong to]] the [[20_Vocabulary/phylum|phylum]] Tardigrada. Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre, though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length. They are also sometimes called 'water bears': 'water' because that's where they thrive best, and 'bear' because of the way they move. ***Q31***. '[[20_Vocabulary/moss|Moss]] piglet' is another name for tardigrades because of the way they look when viewed from the front. They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze, who [[20_Vocabulary/coined|coined]] the name *Tardigrada*.

As I say, there are many different species of [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]] — too many to describe here — but, [[20_Vocabulary/generally speaking|generally speaking]], the different species share similar physical traits. They have a body which is short, ***Q32***, and also rounded — a bit like [[20_Vocabulary/a barrel|a barrel]] — and the body comprises four segments. Each [[20_Vocabulary/segment|segment]] has a pair of legs, at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws. I should also say that some species don't have any claws: what they have are discs, ***Q33***, and these work by [[20_Vocabulary/means of suction|means of suction]]. They enable the [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]] to [[20_Vocabulary/cling|cling]] to surfaces or to grip its prey. Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all. Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in [[20_Vocabulary/a fluid|a fluid]] that fills [[20_Vocabulary/the cavity of the body|the cavity of the body]]. ***Q34***

As far as the [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]]'s head is concerned, the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange — [[20_Vocabulary/a bit squashed|a bit squashed]] even — though many of the websites I looked at described its [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|appearance]] as cute, which isn't exactly very scientific. The [[20_Vocabulary/tardigrade|tardigrade]]'s mouth is a kind of tube ***Q35*** that can open outwards to [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|reveal]] teeth-like structures known as 'stylets'. These are sharp enough to [[20_Vocabulary/pierce|pierce]] plant or animal cells.

So, where are tardigrades found? Well, they live in every part of the world, in a [[20_Vocabulary/variety|variety]] of habitats: most commonly, on [[20_Vocabulary/the bed of a lake|the bed of a lake]], or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments. There's been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are [[20_Vocabulary/capable|capable]] of surviving [[20_Vocabulary/radiation|radiation]] and very high pressure, and they're also able to withstand temperatures as low as minus –200 degrees centigrade, or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade, ***Q36***, which is incredibly hot.

—————————————–

It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been [[20_Vocabulary/wiped out|wiped out]], even in the event of [[20_Vocabulary/an asteroid|an asteroid]] hitting the earth. If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are [[20_Vocabulary/at risk of drying out|at risk of drying out]], they enter a state called [[20_Vocabulary/cryptobiosis|cryptobiosis]]. They form a little ball, called a tun — that's T-U-N — by retracting their head and legs, and their [[20_Vocabulary/metabolism|metabolism]] drops to less than one percent of normal levels. They can stay in this state for decades, and if re-introduced to water, when they [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] come back to life in a matter of a few hours. While in this state of [[20_Vocabulary/cryptobiosis|cryptobiosis]], tardigrades [[20_Vocabulary/produce|produce]] a protein that protects their DNA. ***Q37***. In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years. There was a report that,in 1948, a 120-year-old tun was revived, but this experiment has never been repeated. There are currently several tests [[20_Vocabulary/taking place in space|taking place in space]], to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there. ***Q38***. I believe the record so far is 10 day.

So, erm, moving on. In terms of their [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]], tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive. Although they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing. They suck the juices from [[20_Vocabulary/moss|moss]], or extract fluid from [[20_Vocabulary/seaweed|seaweed]], ***Q39***, but some species prey on other tardigrades, from other species or within their own. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] this isn't surprising, given that tardigrades are [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of [[20_Vocabulary/gel|gel]].

Finally, I'd like to mention the [[20_Vocabulary/conservation|conservation]] status of tardigrades. It is estimated that they have been in [[20_Vocabulary/existence|existence]] for [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|approximately]] half a billion years and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions. So, it [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] come as no [[20_Vocabulary/surprise|surprise]] to you, that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for [[20_Vocabulary/conservation|Conservation]] of Nature and are not on any endangered list. ***Q40***. Some researchers have described them as thriving.

Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?
