The group contains some of the most [[20_Vocabulary/eye-catching|prominent]] women in UK tech, including Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, BT Group boss Allison Kirkby [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Dr Hayaatun Sillem,

The government has launched a new taskforce it says [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] women "[[20_Vocabulary/entrance|enter]], stay [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] lead" in the UK tech sector.

Led by technology secretary Liz Kendall, it [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] see female leaders from tech companies [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] organisations advise the government on how to [[20_Vocabulary/promote|boost]] [[20_Vocabulary/variety|diversity]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] economic growth in the [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]].

BCS, the Chartered [[20_Vocabulary/establish|Institute]] for IT, recently suggested women accounted for [[20_Vocabulary/sole|only]] 22% of those [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] in IT specialist roles in the UK.

Ms Kendall said the Women in Tech group [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] "[[20_Vocabulary/degrade|break down]] the barriers that still [[20_Vocabulary/hold|hold]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] many people back".

"When women are inspired to [[20_Vocabulary/take up the challenge|take on]] a role in tech [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have a seat at the table, the sector can make more [[20_Vocabulary/ambassador|representative]] decisions, [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]] that [[20_Vocabulary/serve|serve]] everyone," she said.

BCS, the Chartered [[20_Vocabulary/establish|Institute]] for IT, [warned in December](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/supercharging-the-trend-of-women-choosing-tech-careers-is-key-to-uk-s-ai-ambitions-new-report-finds/) the amount of women [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] in the UK tech sector still lagged far behind men.

It said the government should [[20_Vocabulary/appearance|look]] to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] close the gender gap in [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] to meet its [ambitious AI goals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crr05jykzkxo).

"We cannot [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|create]] high-trust, high-integrity AI systems [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the profession behind them is [[20_Vocabulary/absence|missing]] out on the talents [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/perspective|perspective]] of half the [[20_Vocabulary/the number of inhabitants|population]]," said chief executive Sharron Gunn.

Ms Kendall [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] lead the taskforce alongside Anne-Marie Imafidon, founder of Stemettes, who has been appointed as the Women in Tech [[20_Vocabulary/ambassador|Envoy]].

Dr Imafidon, who passed A-level computing [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|aged]] 11 [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] received a Master's Degree in Maths [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Computer Science from the University of Oxford [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|aged]] 20, has sought to [[20_Vocabulary/encourage|encourage]] more young women into careers in Stem - science, technology, engineering [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] maths.

She told the BBC her role [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/establish|build]] on more than a [[20_Vocabulary/decade|decade]] of work to [[20_Vocabulary/establish|establish]] greater equality for - [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] representation of - women.

[[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] now, amid what she called "a fourth [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industrial]] revolution", was a key moment to "be [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] [[20_Vocabulary/shift|shifting]] who is making those decisions for what comes next".

"This isn't just [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] having women [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] the driving force [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] building the technology, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this is [[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] building technology that benefits everybody," she said.

## 'Equality long overdue'

The government said the taskforce [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] advise on ways to make the tech sector more [[20_Vocabulary/ambassador|representative]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] "ensure the UK accesses the full talent pool, market [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opportunities]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/invent|innovation]] capacity needed for economic growth".

BT Group boss Allison Kirkby, Revolut chief executive Francesca Carlesi [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Dr Hayaatun Sillem, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering, are among its 15 founding members.

It [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] includes TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell, director of [[20_Vocabulary/publicity|public]] policy at Uber Emma O'Dwyer, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Sue Daley, director of technology [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/invent|innovation]] at [[20_Vocabulary/industrial function|industry]] group techUK.

"[[20_Vocabulary/entrance|Entry]] routes, career [[20_Vocabulary/a few chords|progression]] to leadership, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] access to [[20_Vocabulary/major city|capital]] are just some of the barriers women in tech still [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|face]] today," Ms Daley said.

"[[20_Vocabulary/achieve|Achieving]] gender equality is long overdue, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I am honoured to [[20_Vocabulary/come along|join]] the Women in Tech taskforce alongside Liz Kendall [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] several inspiring women from [[30_Structures/across the industry|across the industry]], [[20_Vocabulary/group cooperation|working together]] [[30_Structures/to chart a path forward|to chart a path forward]] for true gender equality."
