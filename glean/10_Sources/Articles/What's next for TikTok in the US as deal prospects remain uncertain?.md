A billionaire investor [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen on]] buying [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]]'s US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms.

The US has [[20_Vocabulary/a couple of times|repeatedly]] delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, must sell or be blocked for American users.

US President Donald Trump initially gave himself until December 16 to comply with the [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|law]] before moving the deadline to 23 January 2026 with a new executive [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]].

"We're just standing by [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] waiting to see what happens," investor Frank McCourt told BBC News.

"[[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the [[20_Vocabulary/major city|capital]] to buy it - we'll see."

The [[20_Vocabulary/widespread|popular]] [[20_Vocabulary/brief|short]]-[[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]] video app was [[20_Vocabulary/due to|due to]] be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|law]] passed by [[20_Vocabulary/conference|Congress]] in 2024.

Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] expressed fears Beijing could force the [[20_Vocabulary/organisation|company]] to hand [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] [[20_Vocabulary/statistic|data]] on US users.

It's a [[20_Vocabulary/aspects of caring|concern]] [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] its owners have always said is unfounded.

The [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|law]] was signed by President Joe Biden [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] he was still in office [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] was upheld by the [[20_Vocabulary/ultimate|Supreme]] Court in early 2025.

## Deal done?

Trump [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] members of his administration [have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyng762q4eo), [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president has [[20_Vocabulary/What's more|also]] said "sophisticated" US investors [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]] in acquiring [the app](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html), including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Dell Technologies' Michael Dell.

Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be formalised in a [[20_Vocabulary/conference|meeting]] between Trump [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Xi in October - [[20_Vocabulary/However|however]] it concluded [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] an agreement [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] reached.

Neither [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]]'s Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, [[20_Vocabulary/However|despite]] Trump's [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claims]].

When Trump signed his most recent executive [[20_Vocabulary/arrange|order]] extending the deadline to January, he said in an online [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|post]] it [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/resulted in|lead to]] a deal [[20_Vocabulary/existence|being]] completed.

[[20_Vocabulary/absence|Without]] naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned "[[20_Vocabulary/approximately|about]] a [[20_Vocabulary/concentration|concentration]] of power [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/manipulate|influence]] because platforms [[20_Vocabulary/For instance|like]] [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] are very [[20_Vocabulary/influential|influencing]]".

He is [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary.

"My hope [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] lands in the hands of people that comply with the [[20_Vocabulary/legislation|law]]," he said.

He said he wants to operate [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] [[20_Vocabulary/absence|without]] any of its Chinese technology, including its [[20_Vocabulary/effective|powerful]] recommendation algorithm,[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that his [[20_Vocabulary/scheme|Project]] Liberty has [[20_Vocabulary/built up|developed]] other technology that could be [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] instead.
