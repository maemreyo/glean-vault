### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 1

WOMAN: Hi Coleman, how are you?

COLEMAN: Good, thanks.

WOMAN: I wanted to have a chat with you because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it sounds interesting. I'd really like to learn myself.

COLEMAN: Why don't you come along? I'm sure there's room for another person.

WOMAN: Really? So – who runs the classes?

COLEMAN: He's called a 'coordinator' – his name's Gary Mathieson.

WOMAN: Let me note that down. Gary.... How do you [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spell]] his surname?

COLEMAN: It's M-A-T-H-I-E-S-O-N.

WOMAN: Right, thanks.

COLEMAN: He's retired, actually, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] he's a really nice guy [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] he used to play in a lot of bands.

WOMAN: Thanks. So how long have you been going?

COLEMAN: About a month now.

WOMAN: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] could you play anything before you started?

COLEMAN: I knew [[20_Vocabulary/a few chords|a few chords]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that's all.

WOMAN: I'm sure everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be better than me.

COLEMAN: That's what I thought, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. When I first spoke to Gary on the phone, he said it was a class for beginners, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I was still worried that everyone [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be better than me, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we were [[20_Vocabulary/all equally hopeless|all equally hopeless]]!

WOMAN: Oh, that's [[20_Vocabulary/reassuring|reassuring]]. So where do you meet?

COLEMAN: Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town. I prefer going there.

WOMAN: I know that place. I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school. I haven't been since, though [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I can't [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|remember]] what road it's in… is it Lock Street?

COLEMAN: It's just [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|beyond]] there at the bottom of New Street near the [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] roundabout.

WOMAN: Yes, of course.

COLEMAN: The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.

WOMAN: Right. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] when do you meet? Is it at the weekend?

COLEMAN: We meet on Thursdays. It used to be 10.30 [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[30_Structures/that suited me well|that suited me well]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] now we meet at 11. The class that's in there before us asked [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] they could have the room for another 30 minutes.

[[20_Vocabulary/Bookshelves|Bookshelves]]

WOMAN: Oh, I see. Well, I'd love to come, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I don't have a guitar.

COLEMAN: Well, you can always buy a second-hand one. There's a website called 'The perfect instrument ' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] so on. I'm sure you'll find something there.

————————————–

WOMAN: So what's a [[20_Vocabulary/average|typical]] lesson like with Gary?

COLEMAN: Well, he always starts by getting us to [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] our guitars. That takes about five minutes.

WOMAN: Uhuh.

COLEMAN: Some people have an app they use, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] others do it by ear. Gary goes round [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] helps them. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] he's doing that, he tells us what he's [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] do during the lesson.

WOMAN: Right.

COLEMAN: First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some [[20_Vocabulary/strumming|strumming]].

WOMAN: So is that using... what are they called... [[20_Vocabulary/plectrums|plectrums]]?

COLEMAN: No – we just use our [[20_Vocabulary/thumbs|thumbs]].

WOMAN: Much easier.

COLEMAN: Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then we play them together. Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time, so Gary starts clapping to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] us.

WOMAN: Do you learn to play any songs?

COLEMAN: Yes – we do at least one song with words [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] chords. I [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] that's harder than you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]].

WOMAN: Oh, I'm sure it is!

COLEMAN: That [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|part]] of the lesson takes about 15 minutes. He often brings a recording of the song [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] plays it to us first. Then he [[20_Vocabulary/hands out the song|hands out the song]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] there's a new [[20_Vocabulary/chord|chord]] in it, we practise that before we play it together – [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] really slowly.

WOMAN: Do you do any [[20_Vocabulary/finger picking|finger picking]]?

COLEMAN: That's the [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]] ten minutes of the lesson, when we pick out the individual notes from a [[20_Vocabulary/tune|tune]] he's made up. It's always quite simple.

WOMAN: That must be hard, though.

COLEMAN: It is, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] people like it because they can really [[20_Vocabulary/concentration|concentrate]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we're all playing well, it sounds quite [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressive]]. The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time – you know, [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|alone]].

WOMAN: That's scary.

COLEMAN: It is, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I've got used to it now. At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.

WOMAN: Well, thanks Coleman. I'll go [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] have a look at that website, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]].

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

I never really [[20_Vocabulary/meant|planned]] to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea. I'd been [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] in London as a website designer, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] that was interesting, I didn't like [[20_Vocabulary/city dweller|city]] life. I'd been really [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen on]] boats as a teenager, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I thought [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] I went to live by the sea, I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time. Then I [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers, so I decided to apply.

The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss; it's one of the largest in the country. It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous [[20_Vocabulary/participant|member]] of the public, who'd lived here all her life. As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation, rather than funding provided by the government, that kind of [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] is much needed.

When I applied, I had to have a [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] assessment. The doctors were particularly [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested in]] my vision. I used to be short-sighted, so I'd had to wear glasses, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was OK. They gave me tests for colour blindness [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they thought I might have a problem there, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it turned out I was OK.

When the coastguard gets an alert, all the volunteers are contacted [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] rush to the lifeboat station. Our [[20_Vocabulary/mark|target]]'s to get there in five minutes, then we try to get the boat off the dock [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] out to sea in another six to eight minutes. Our team's proud that we usually achieve that – the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] time across the country's eight [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] a half minutes.

[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|As well]] as steering the lifeboat, as a 'helmsman', I have the ultimate [[20_Vocabulary/responsible for|responsibility]] for the lifeboat. I have to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|check]] that the [[20_Vocabulary/equipment|equipment]] we use is in [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|working]] order – we have special life jackets that can [[20_Vocabulary/hold|support]] up four people in the water. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] it's [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|ultimately]] my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] it's very rare not to launch, [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] in the worst weather.

[[20_Vocabulary/In addition|As well]] as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. A lot of people underestimate how windy conditions can [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] at sea, so I speak to youth groups [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] sailing clubs in the area about the sorts of problems that sailors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] swimmers can have [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the weather suddenly gets bad. We [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we couldn't [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|manage]] without them.

The training we get is a continuous process, focusing on technical competence [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] safe handling techniques, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking. I was glad I'd done a first [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|aid]] course before I started, as that's a big [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] with the casualty [[20_Vocabulary/treatment|care]] activities we do. We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/relationship|tie]] knots – that's an [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] [[20_Vocabulary/an art form|skill]]. After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists. They had a wave-tank where they could [[20_Vocabulary/invent|create]] extreme weather conditions – so we could get [[20_Vocabulary/go through|experience]] at what to do [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.

Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.

[[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] the work's hugely motivating. It's not just about [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|saving]] lives – I've learned a lot about the technology involved. My background in IT's been [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]] here, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I can use my expertise to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] other volunteers. They're a great group – we're like a family really, which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time. That's when the incidents [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] be more serious, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] you realise that you can make a huge difference to the [[20_Vocabulary/impact|outcome]].

So [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] any of you listeners are [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|interested]]…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

BELLA: Hi Don – did you get the copy of the article on recycling footwear that I emailed you?

DON: Yeah – it's here … I've had a look at it.

BELLA: So do you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it's a good topic for our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]]?

DON: Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling footwear, well, [[20_Vocabulary/However|although]] it's quite interesting, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]] there isn't enough to say about it, cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that's about it.

Shop for bestsellers

BELLA: … [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there's much more to it than that.

DON: I realise that now [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I'm [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen]] to research the topic more.

BELLA: That's great.

DON: One of the things I didn't realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!

BELLA: Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now. They've become more popular than [[20_Vocabulary/average|ordinary]] shoes.

DON: I know. I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] they are very hard-wearing, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] don't they look a bit [[20_Vocabulary/formal|casual]] for school [[20_Vocabulary/apron|uniform]]? I don't [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] they're right for that.

BELLA: Actually, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] some of them look quite smart on pupils … better than a scruffy [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] pair of shoes.

DON: So do you [[20_Vocabulary/hold|keep]] shoes a long time?

BELLA: Yes. Though I do [[20_Vocabulary/tend to|tend to]] wear my [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] pairs for doing [[20_Vocabulary/filthy|dirty]] jobs like cleaning my bike.

BELLA: I must [[20_Vocabulary/admit|admit]], I've recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven't gone out of fashion [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] still fit, just because they don't look great on me any more. That's awful isn't it?

DON: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it's [[20_Vocabulary/average|common]] because there's so much choice. The article did say that recent sales of footwear have increased enormously.

BELLA: That didn't surprise me.

DON: No. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] then it said that the amount of recycled footwear has fallen: it's 6 percent now compared to a previous level of 11 percent. That doesn't seem to make sense.

BELLA: That's because not everything goes through the recycling process. Some footwear just isn't good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] gets rejected.

——————————————-

BELLA: So let's find some examples in the article of footwear that was rejected for recycling.

DON: OK. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] there are some in the interview with the recycling manager. Yeah – here it is.

BELLA: Mmm. Let's start with the ladies' high-heeled shoes. What did he say about those?

DON: He said they were [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] [[20_Vocabulary/expensive|expensive]] – the material was suede [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they were beige in colour – it looked like someone had only worn them once, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] in a very wet field so the heels were [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] stained with mud [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] grass to re-sell them.

BELLA: OK … [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the leather ankle boots. What was wrong with them?

DON: Apparently, the heels were worn – [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] that wasn't the problem. One of the shoes was a much lighter shade than the other one – it had obviously been left in the sun. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] second-hand shoes should look the same!

BELLA: Sure. Then there were the red baby shoes.

DON: Oh yes – we're told to [[20_Vocabulary/relationship|tie]] shoes together when we put them in a recycling bin, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] people often don't bother.

BELLA: You'd [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have been easy to find the other, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it wasn't. That was a shame because they were obviously new.

DON: The trainers were interesting. He said they looked like they'd been worn by a marathon runner.

BELLA: Yeah – weren't they split?

DON: Not exactly. One of the soles was so worn under the foot that you could put your finger through it.

BELLA: Well, we could [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|certainly]] use some of those examples in our [[20_Vocabulary/presentation|presentation]] to explain why 90 percent of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into landfill.

DON: Mmm. What did you [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] shoes?

BELLA: It sounded like a good idea. They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts. I wasn't surprised that it failed, though. I [[20_Vocabulary/average|mean]] who wants to buy second-hand shoes really? [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|Think]] of all the germs you could catch!

DON: Well, people didn't refuse them for that reason, did they? It was because the pairs of shoes weren't identical.

BELLA: They still managed to ship them overseas, though.

DON: That's another area we need to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discuss]].

BELLA: You know I used to [[20_Vocabulary/bear in mind|consider]] this topic just from my own perspective, by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture. So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.

DON: It's not as simple as you first [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] we can show that by taking a very different [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|approach]] to it.

BELLA: [[20_Vocabulary/Unquestionably|Absolutely]]. So let's [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|discuss]] …

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades. These are microscopic — or to be more precise — near-microscopic animals. There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals, which belong to the phylum Tardigrada. Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre, though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length. They are [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] sometimes called 'water bears': 'water' because that's where they thrive best, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] 'bear' because of the way they move. 'Moss piglet' is another name for tardigrades because of the way they look when viewed from the front. They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze, who coined the name Tardigrada.

As I say, there are many different species of tardigrade — [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] many to describe here — [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]], generally speaking, the different species [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] similar physical traits. They have a body which is short, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] [[20_Vocabulary/curve|rounded]] — a bit like a barrel — [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the body comprises four segments. Each segment has a pair of legs, at the end of which are between four [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] eight sharp claws. I should [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] say that some species don't have any claws: what they have are discs, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these work by means of suction. They enable the tardigrade to cling to surfaces or to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|grip]] its prey. Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all. Instead, oxygen [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and also]] blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body.

As far as the tardigrade's head is concerned, the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange — a bit squashed [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] — though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute, which isn't exactly very scientific. The tardigrade's mouth is a kind of tube that can open outwards to [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|reveal]] teeth-like structures known as 'stylets'. These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells.

So, where are tardigrades [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]]? Well, they live in every [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|part]] of the world, in a variety of habitats: most commonly, on the bed of a lake, or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments. There's been some interesting research which has [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] that tardigrades are capable of [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|surviving]] radiation [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] very high [[20_Vocabulary/press|pressure]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] they're [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] able to withstand temperatures as low as [[20_Vocabulary/downside|minus]] –200 degrees centigrade, or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade, which is [[20_Vocabulary/incredible|incredibly]] hot.

—————————————–

It has been said that tardigrades could [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]] long after human beings have been wiped out, [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] conditions become [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] extreme [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] tardigrades are at risk of drying out, they enter a state called cryptobiosis. They [[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]] a little ball, called a tun — that's T-U-N — by retracting their head [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] legs, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] their metabolism drops to less than one percent of [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] levels. They can stay in this state for [[20_Vocabulary/decade|decades]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] re-introduced to water, when they [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] come back to life in a matter of a few hours. [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|While]] in this state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA. In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years. There was a report that,in 1948, a 120-year-[[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] tun was revived, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this experiment has never been repeated. There are currently several tests taking place in space, to [[20_Vocabulary/affect|determine]] how long tardigrades might be able to [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]] there. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|believe]] the record so far is 10 day.

So, erm, moving on. In terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|survive]]. [[20_Vocabulary/However|Although]] they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing. They suck the juices from moss, or [[20_Vocabulary/remove|extract]] fluid from seaweed, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] some species prey on other tardigrades, from other species or within [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] this isn't [[20_Vocabulary/a real eye-opener|surprising]], given that tardigrades are [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] comprised of liquid [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are coated with a type of gel.

[[20_Vocabulary/Lastly|Finally]], I'd like to [[20_Vocabulary/talk about|mention]] the conservation status of tardigrades. It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]], in that time, they have [[20_Vocabulary/outlive|survived]] five mass extinctions. So, it [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/probably|probably]] come as no surprise to you, that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of [[20_Vocabulary/messy nature|Nature]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] are not on any endangered list. Some researchers have described them as thriving.

Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?
