### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 1

LEON: Hi Shannon – how are you settling into your new flat?

SHANNON: Really well, thanks.

LEON: You look like you're going shopping.

SHANNON: Yes, I am. My cousins are coming to stay for a couple of days, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I have to cook for them.

LEON: Well, there are plenty of places to buy food in Kite Place – it's the area by the harbour. ***Q1***

SHANNON: Oh. OK, I'll find that on the map. Thanks.

LEON: What sort of food do you need to get?

SHANNON: Well, neither of them eats meat [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they both like fish.

LEON: Well, there's a really good fish market there.

SHANNON: Oh great – where is it exactly?

LEON: It's at the far end of Kite Place, so you have to [[20_Vocabulary/look over|go over]] the bridge [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] then it's on the right. ***Q2***

SHANNON: OK – is it open all day?

LEON: It doesn't close until four, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I'd [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] going earlier than that – it does run [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|out of]] some things.

SHANNON: Oh, I don't want that to happen.

LEON: As long as you get there by 3.30. you should be fine. It's only 11 now, so plenty of time. ***Q3***

SHANNON: Right.

LEON: Do you need to buy vegetables [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]?

SHANNON: I do, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I want to avoid all the plastic packaging in the supermarket!

LEON: Well, there's a really nice organic shop there. Now what's it called … it's the name of a flower. I know, it's ' Rose '. ***Q4***

SHANNON: That's a nice name.

LEON: Yeah – it sells vegetables [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] quite a lot of other stuff.

SHANNON: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] where's that?

LEON: Well, as you reach the market, you'll see a big grey building on your left – I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] to be a [[20_Vocabulary/Warehouse|warehouse]]. Anyway, now it's a restaurant upstairs, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] the ground floor has two shops either side of the entrance [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] it's the one on the left.

SHANNON: That's easy enough.

LEON: You can't miss it – there's [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] a big sign on the pavement so you can look for that. ***Q5***

SHANNON: Fine! I [[20_Vocabulary/guess|guess]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] I need anything else, I'll have to go to the supermarket.

LEON: Yeah – you should be able to get everything you need, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there's a minibus that goes to the supermarket [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you need it. It's purple [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the number is 289. ***Q6***

SHANNON: Thanks, that's great.

LEON: So what do you need to get at the fish market? The [[20_Vocabulary/salmon|salmon]] is always very good [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the shellfish.

SHANNON: I'm [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] make a curry, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I need about 12 prawns for that.

LEON: They'll have plenty of those.

SHANNON: OK.

LEON: Have you ever tried samphire? ***Q7***

SHANNON: No – what's that?

LEON: It's a type of [[20_Vocabulary/seaweed|seaweed]]. I just ask for a handful [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] you fry it in butter. It's delicious!

SHANNON: Oh, I might try that- how do you [[20_Vocabulary/spelt|spell]] it?

LEON: It's S-A-M-P-H-l-R-E.

SHANNON: Great – it's always good to try something different.

LEON: Yeah.

SHANNON: I'll see what beans they have in the organic shop [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] I'll get something for dessert there.

LEON: How about a mango?

SHANNON: I'm not sure – they're not always ripe. I'd prefer a melon – it's bigger [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]]. ***Q8***

LEON: Good idea. The owner [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] sells a lot of spices there that you can put in a curry, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] things like coconut. ***Q9***

SHANNON: Oh, that's very [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|helpful]]. I'll have a look.

LEON: No problem.

SHANNON: I know bread doesn't really go with curry [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I always like to have some in case.

LEON: As I said – all the bread is home-made [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] there's lots of variety. I like the brown bread myself.

SHANNON: Mm, sounds good.

LEON: They sell other things there [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]].

SHANNON: Like cakes? I love chocolate cake.

LEON: Well – not that, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they have a whole range of tarts [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the best are the strawberry ones. ***Q10***

SHANNON: Perfect – hopefully I won t [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] have to go to the supermarket!

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 2

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: The children's book festival is coming up again soon [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] here to tell us all about it is the festival's organiser, Jenny Morgan. So tell us what we can expect this year, Jenny.

JENNY: Well, as [[20_Vocabulary/average|usual]] we've got five days of action-packed exciting events for children, with writers coming from all [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] the country getting [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involved]].

Just to give you an idea of what's on [[20_Vocabulary/propose|offer]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshops]], first of all, there's a very special event called Superheroes. This is a [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] for deaf children to [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] their reading experiences with author Madeleine Gordon, who is herself hearing impaired. ***Q11***

'Just do it' is a practical [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]] led by the well-known illustrator [[20_Vocabulary/mark|Mark]] Keane. He'll take participants on a magical [[20_Vocabulary/boat trip|journey]] to faraway lands with an [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|opportunity]] for aspiring actors to do some role play. ***Q12***

'[[20_Vocabulary/depend on|Count on]] me' is an inspiring [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] entertaining look at the issues of friendship for 13–14-year-olds. ***Q13***. It looks at some of the friendships described in popular books [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] asks participants to compare these with [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]] experiences.

'Speak up' is [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] a series of [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshops]] on the subject of [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|mental health]]. This is a [[20_Vocabulary/an art form|creative]] writing [[20_Vocabulary/workshop|workshop]] encouraging children to describe situations where young people [[20_Vocabulary/go through|experience]] [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|loneliness]]. A recent [[20_Vocabulary/Have a look around|survey]] [[20_Vocabulary/reveal|revealed]] that children can be [[20_Vocabulary/loneliness|lonely]] [[20_Vocabulary/steadily|even]] when they're at home with their families. ***Q14***

'Jump for joy', as many of you [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] know, is the [[20_Vocabulary/cardiovascular disease|heart]]-warming, best-selling story by Nina Karan about a young girl's trip to visit her [[20_Vocabulary/extended family|relatives]] in India. It recently received the gold medal at the Waterford Awards. Nina [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] get children to celebrate the word 'joy' by writing a poem. ***Q15***

'Sticks [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] stones' is the beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers about a community who organise an African-Caribbean festival to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] [[20_Vocabulary/neighbour|local]] children learn about their Jamaican roots. ***Q16***. This [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] be a musical event where children [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] have the [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] to play steel drums. This is bound to be very popular, so please book as soon as [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]].

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: Thanks Jenny. That all sounds really interesting. I'm just wondering [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] you have a [[20_Vocabulary/favourite|favourite]] book you could [[20_Vocabulary/propose|recommend]] for our readers?

JENNY: It's hard to choose, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] *Alive [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Kicking* is [[20_Vocabulary/definite|definitely]] [[20_Vocabulary/worth|worth]] mentioning. You won't have heard of the writer as it's her first book – which is really [[20_Vocabulary/impress|impressive]]. It's [[20_Vocabulary/Basically|basically]] the teenage diary of a boy from Somalia who comes to live in the UK. It deals with the serious issue of immigration ***Q17/18*** [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] all the challenges the boy has to [[20_Vocabulary/dealing|face]] at school [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] with the language barrier, etc. Usually, books like this are quite sad, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this one actually made me cry with laughter. ***Q17/18***. On each page, there are simple [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] hilarious black [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] white stick drawings of the boy with his friends [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] teachers. At the end of each diary entry, there are new English words the boy learns each day, which may [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] develop some children's vocabulary.

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] my kids [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoy]] that. What about any advice for parents on how to [[20_Vocabulary/motivate|encourage]] their children to read more?

JENNY: Well, this is something I get asked about a lot. There are so many distractions for kids these days that it can be hard to find time for reading. One thing I'd say is to make time to sit down with your child [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|share]] books with them. A lot of parents give up reading aloud to their children as soon as they learn to read [[20_Vocabulary/independently|independently]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] this is a mistake. It's good to read more advanced books to them as it helps to develop their vocabulary. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you don't have time for this, then let them listen to audio books. Often, they'll want to read books they've listened to [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|for themselves]]. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] it's a good idea to make a [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|mental]] note of the type of books your child is reading – often they just read the same genre all the time, which can get a bit boring. You can introduce new authors [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] genres to them. Librarians should be able to [[20_Vocabulary/rescue|help]] you with this. ***Q19/20***

[[20_Vocabulary/presentation|PRESENTER]]: Well Jenny, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] that's really [[20_Vocabulary/beneficial|useful]]….

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 3

CLARE: Hi Jake. How are you getting on with the practical teaching?

JAKE: It's harder than I expected, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I've got some great classes. How about you?

CLARE: Not brilliant. I'm really struggling with my Year 12 science class.

JAKE: Are they hard to control?

CLARE: Well, I don't have discipline problems as such. It's just that they don't [[20_Vocabulary/seem to|seem to]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] that science has anything to do with their lives. It's [[20_Vocabulary/depression|depressing]]. They listen to what I say, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I gave them a test [[20_Vocabulary/stands the test of time|last]] week [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the results weren't [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|too]] bad, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] there's no real [[20_Vocabulary/interaction|engagement]]. ***Q21***

JAKE: Right.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] as [[20_Vocabulary/belong to|part of]] my teaching practice, I have to design [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] for them to do. I was wondering about something on the children's diets… you know, asking them to record what they eat [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] linking it to their state of [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]].

JAKE: Mmm. Let's [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]]. So your methodology [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involve]] the children recording what they eat. OK, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] you'd [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] need to have access to the children's [[20_Vocabulary/clinical form|medical records]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] I don't [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] people [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be happy about that; confidentiality [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be an issue. [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|If]] you could get the right data, the conclusions might be significant, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suspect|suspect]] it's just not [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be easy. ***Q22***

CLARE: Right.

JAKE: Have you thought about doing [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] using animals?

CLARE: Wouldn't that be upsetting for the children?

JAKE: Well, the animals don't have to be [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harmed]] in any way. It could just be [[20_Vocabulary/an experiment|an experiment]] where they're given a certain [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the effects are observed.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Would]] I have to get permission to use animals?

JAKE: Yes, you'd have to submit an outline of the experiment [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] fill in a [[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] it's quite straightforward.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] we [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] out that, say, a particular [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]] affects the [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] of animals, the same thing wouldn't necessarily be true for people, [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] it? ***Q23***

JAKE: No that's true, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] the findings for any experiment are [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be limited. It's inevitable.

CLARE: I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] so. So what animals could I use to investigate the effects of [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]]? Mice?

JAKE: Yes. You'd need experimental mice – ones that have been specially bred for experiments. OK, so what [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] your experiment be investigating exactly?

CLARE: Well, something to do with nutrition. So [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] we could look at food supplements… things like [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] iron [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] protein, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] their [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact on]] [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]].

JAKE: Mmm. That might be rather broad. [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|Maybe]] just look at the effects of one [[20_Vocabulary/supplement|supplement]], like sugar, on the [[20_Vocabulary/mental health|health]] of the mice?

CLARE: In fact, [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|maybe]] the focus could be on whether mice can control [[20_Vocabulary/themselves|their own]] [[20_Vocabulary/diet|diet]]. ***Q24***

JAKE: So, what happens when they have access to more sugar, that they don't really need?

CLARE: Exactly. Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?

JAKE: Great. Then later on, you could do a [[20_Vocabulary/pursue|follow]]-up experiment adding another variable. Like, you could give some of the mice the [[20_Vocabulary/opportunity|chance]] to be more active, running on a wheel or something, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the others just sit around [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] don't do much. ***Q25***

CLARE: Or I could [[20_Vocabulary/repeat|repeat]] the experiment [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/affect|change]] the type of food I provided... or use mice with a different genetic structure. [[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] your idea [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be more interesting, I might [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] about that some more.

CLARE: So can I talk through a [[20_Vocabulary/a possibility|possible]] procedure for the experiment where mice are given a sugar [[20_Vocabulary/supplement|supplement]]?

JAKE: Sure. I did a similar experiment in college actually.

CLARE: Great. So how many mice [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] I need?

JAKE: I'd say about 12. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] all young ones, not a mixture of [[20_Vocabulary/elderly|old]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] young. ***Q26***

CLARE: OK. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] I'd need two groups of equal sizes, so six in each group. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] how [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] I tell them apart? I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] I could put some sort of tag on one group… or just [[20_Vocabulary/mark|mark]] them in some way?

JAKE: You could use food colouring, that wouldn't [[20_Vocabulary/harm|hurt]] them. ***Q27***

CLARE: Perfect. Then each group [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] go into [[20_Vocabulary/a separate cage|a separate cage]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] one group, let's call them group A, [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be the control group. So they'd just have [[20_Vocabulary/average|ordinary]] mouse food. I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|suppose]] you can buy that?

JAKE: Yes, it comes in dry pellets.

CLARE: [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] the other group [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] have the same as the first group, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] they'd [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] have the [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|extra]] sugar.

JAKE: [[20_Vocabulary/will|Would]] you just give them straight sugar?

CLARE: I might be better to give them something like [[20_Vocabulary/cereal|cereal]] with it. ***Q28***

JAKE: Hmm. Then you'd need to weigh the mice, I should [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] once a week. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] you'd need an electronic balance.

JAKE: Exactly. So you need something called a weighing chamber to stop the mice from running away. It sounds complicated, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] actually you can just use a plastic box with holes in the top. ***Q29***

CLARE: OK. So once we've measured the weight gain of each mouse we can work out the [[20_Vocabulary/average|average]] for each group, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|as well]] as the [[20_Vocabulary/average|standard]] deviation. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|And]] then see where we go from there. That sounds cool, I [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|think]] the students [[20_Vocabulary/will|will]] [[20_Vocabulary/enjoy|enjoy]] it. ***Q30***

JAKE: Yes. One thing…

### [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|PART]] 4

In today's lecture, I'm [[20_Vocabulary/will|going to]] be talking about microplastics.

Microplastics are [[20_Vocabulary/tiny|tiny]] [[20_Vocabulary/piece|pieces]] of plastic smaller than five millimetres in size. Recently there's been a greater [[20_Vocabulary/awareness|awareness]] that there are large quantities of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] – big [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] small – in the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]]. The amount of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] in the oceans has received widespread [[20_Vocabulary/attention|attention]], [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] far less is known about the effects of microplastics in freshwater [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] particularly in [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]].

Microplastics can enter the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]] via a number of different sources. Threads [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] microfibres detach from synthetic clothing ***Q31*** every time they're put in a washing machine, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these find their way into the water system. Other sources include big [[20_Vocabulary/piece|pieces]] of plastic [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] that are already in the [[20_Vocabulary/background|environment]], [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] these break down into [[20_Vocabulary/microscopic|microscopic]] particles [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] a period of time. On a larger scale, factory [[20_Vocabulary/refuse|waste]] is another route, as are tyres which [[20_Vocabulary/worn|wear]] down as cars, [[20_Vocabulary/lorries|lorries]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] so on travel along road surfaces.

We already understand some of the [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impacts]] of microplastics from studies [[20_Vocabulary/involve|involving]] fish [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] other animals. There is [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|evidence]] that microplastics [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] small creatures in a variety of ways, such as by damaging their mouths, ***Q32***, or by impairing their ability to feed, for example when microplastics get lodged in their [[20_Vocabulary/digestive system|digestive system]].

[[20_Vocabulary/surprise|Surprisingly]] [[20_Vocabulary/perhaps|perhaps]], it is likely that humans consume microplastics, as these have been detected in a wide range of food [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] drink [[20_Vocabulary/goods|products]], including bottled water, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|as well]] as in water that comes direct from the tap. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|What's more]], salt [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] many kinds of seafood have [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] been [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] to [[20_Vocabulary/hold|contain]] microplastics. ***Q33***

[[20_Vocabulary/However|However]], it's important to underline that there is not yet [[20_Vocabulary/conclusion|conclusive]] [[20_Vocabulary/solid evidence|proof]] that microplastics cause significant [[20_Vocabulary/harm|harm]] to people. In many countries, including here in the UK, there is legislation which prevents manufacturers from adding plastic microbeads to shower gels, facial cleansers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] toothpaste. ***Q34***

It is very difficult to accurately [[20_Vocabulary/guess|estimate]] the total amount of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] particles in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] as they can be hard to detect, [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] we do know they are carried in the air [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/deposit|deposited]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] by rain. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|What's more]], many of the fertilisers [[20_Vocabulary/second-hand|used]] by both farmers [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] gardeners [[20_Vocabulary/hold|contain]] microplastics. ***Q35***

A team from the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge has carried out a study of the effects of microplastics on the digestive tracts of earthworms. These worms, which live in topsoil, are an [[20_Vocabulary/essential|essential]] [[20_Vocabulary/segment|component]] of our agricultural system. By feeding on [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], they mix nutrients into it, thereby making it more fertile. ***Q36***

The researchers set out to discover whether the introduction of microplastics into the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] – [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the subsequent ingestion of these by earthworms – [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impact]] [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] quality [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/eventually|ultimately]] inhibit plant growth. ***Q37***. The short answer was, yes, it did. After placing three different types of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] particles into the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], they planted perennial rye [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grass]]. The particles of [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]], which included biodegradable PLA [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] conventional high-density polyethylene, or HDPE, were then ingested by the earthworms in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]]. The [[20_Vocabulary/impact|result]] was that the worms [[20_Vocabulary/disorientation|lost]] weight rapidly. ***Q38***. [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|What's more]], a lower percentage than [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] of the rye [[20_Vocabulary/grass|grass]] seeds germinated, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] the researchers concluded that this was a direct [[20_Vocabulary/impact|result]] of the earthworms being unable to fulfill their [[20_Vocabulary/average|normal]] role in making [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] more fertile. The team [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] discovered that there was an increase in the amount of acid [[20_Vocabulary/establish|found]] in the [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]], ***Q39***, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] this was attributed [[20_Vocabulary/mainly|mainly]] to the [[20_Vocabulary/microplastic|microplastic]] particles from conventional HDPE plastic.

The conclusions of the study make for very interesting reading – I've included the reference in the notes to give you at the end of this session. To summarise, the authors [[20_Vocabulary/propose|proposed]] the idea that we need to regard [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] as we [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] regard any other process in [[20_Vocabulary/messy nature|nature]]. This means we should [[20_Vocabulary/admit|accept]] the implications of [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] being [[20_Vocabulary/depend on|dependent on]] decaying [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] dead matter constantly being passed through the bodies of earthworms. That is, when [[20_Vocabulary/soil|soil]] becomes impoverished by the presence of microplastics, not only ecosystems [[20_Vocabulary/However|but]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] the whole of [[20_Vocabulary/Institution|society]] are negatively [[20_Vocabulary/impact|impacted]]. ***Q40***
