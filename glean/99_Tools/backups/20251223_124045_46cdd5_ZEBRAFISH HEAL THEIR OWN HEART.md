Zebrafish [[30_Structures/embryo development|embryo development]] is controlled by genetic switches activated in perfect order.

Researchers have identified [[30_Structures/a genetic switch|a genetic switch]] in zebrafish that turns on cells, allowing them [[30_Structures/to divide and multiply|to divide and multiply]] after a heart attack and resulting in the complete regeneration and healing of damaged heart muscle in these fish.

It's already known that zebrafish can heal their own hearts, but how they performed this incredible feat remained unknown until now.

This small fish has helped further research into finding treatments for heart disease, deafness, and cancer.

Amazing creation, amazing Creator.
