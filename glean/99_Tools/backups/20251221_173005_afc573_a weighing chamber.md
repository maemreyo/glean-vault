> **IPA:** /ə ˈweɪɪŋ tʃeɪmbər/
> **Part of Speech:** noun phrase
> **CEFR Level:** B2
> **Register:** technical/scientific
> **Etymology:** 'Weighing' from Old English 'wegen' - 'to determine weight' + 'chamber' from Latin 'camera' - 'room, chamber'

> [!abstract] Meanings
> **Root Meaning:** A room for measuring mass
>
> **Context Meaning:** A controlled environment or enclosure designed for precise measurement of weight/mass, typically with stable conditions to ensure accuracy
>
> **Vietnamese Translation:**
> - **Direct:** một phòng cân
