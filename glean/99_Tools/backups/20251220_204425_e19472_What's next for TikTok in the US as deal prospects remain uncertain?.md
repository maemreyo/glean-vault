A billionaire investor [[20_Vocabulary/keen on|keen on]] buying [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]]'s US operations has told the BBC he has been left in limbo as the latest deadline for the app's sale looms.

The US has [[20_Vocabulary/a couple of times|repeatedly]] delayed the date by which the platform's Chinese owner, ByteDance, must sell or be blocked for American users.

US President Donald Trump initially gave himself until December 16 to comply with the law before moving the deadline to 23 January 2026 with a new executive order.

"We're just standing by [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] waiting to see what happens," investor Frank McCourt told BBC News.

"[[20_Vocabulary/However|But]] [[20_Vocabulary/suppose|if]] the moment arrives, we're prepared to move forward... we've raised the [[20_Vocabulary/major city|capital]] to buy it - we'll see."

The popular short-[[20_Vocabulary/curve|form]] video app was due to be banned or sold in the US in January in accordance with a law passed by Congress in 2024.

Lawmakers said at the time ByteDance's links to the Chinese government threatened national security, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] expressed fears Beijing could force the company to hand [[20_Vocabulary/beyond|over]] data on US users.

It's a concern [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] its owners have always said is unfounded.

The law was signed by President Joe Biden [[20_Vocabulary/Admittedly|while]] he was still in office [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] was upheld by the Supreme Court in early 2025.

## Deal done?

Trump [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] members of his administration [have previously claimed a TikTok deal was done](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyng762q4eo), [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] had the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president has [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|also]] said "sophisticated" US investors [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be involved in acquiring [the app](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html), including two of his allies: Oracle chairman Larry Ellison [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Dell Technologies' Michael Dell.

Members of the Trump administration had indicated the deal [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be formalised in a meeting between Trump [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Xi in October - [[20_Vocabulary/However|however]] it concluded without an agreement being reached.

Neither [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]]'s Chinese owner ByteDance nor Beijing have since announced approval of a sale, [[20_Vocabulary/However|despite]] Trump's [[20_Vocabulary/claim|claims]].

When Trump signed his most recent executive order extending the deadline to January, he said in an online [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|post]] it [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] lead to a deal being completed.

Without naming Trump's hand-selected investors, Mr McCourt told the BBC he was concerned "about a [[20_Vocabulary/concentration|concentration]] of power [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] [[20_Vocabulary/impact|influence]] because platforms like [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] are very influencing".

He is [[20_Vocabulary/parcel|part]] of a group of investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary.

"My hope [[20_Vocabulary/will|would]] be that whatever happens, that it is shut down or sold, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] lands in the hands of people that comply with the law," he said.

He said he wants to operate [[20_Vocabulary/social media|TikTok]] without any of its Chinese technology, including its [[20_Vocabulary/effective|powerful]] recommendation algorithm, [[20_Vocabulary/In addition|and]] that his Project Liberty has developed other technology that could be used instead.
