## 🧩 Creating Good Distractors (Wrong Options)

For Card 13 (Synonym Quiz):
- **Plausible but wrong in this context:** A synonym that COULD work but isn't BEST for this specific situation
- **Example:** For "unwind" in after-exam context:
  - [[rest]] - plausible (ngừng hoạt động sau thi) nhưng "unwind" capture release stress tốt hơn
  - [[sleep]] - too specific (ngủ) - có thể là result nhưng không phải ý nghĩa chính

For Card 14 (Antonym Quiz):
- **Different type of opposite:** Antonym that opposes in a different way
- **Example:** For "tense" as antonym of "relax":
  - [[stress]] - mental opposite, not physical
  - [[struggle]] - active opposition, not state
